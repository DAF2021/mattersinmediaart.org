## Project History

Launched in 2005, this collaborative project between the New Art Trust (NAT) and its partner museums – the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) and Tate – has been designed to help those who collect and keep time-based artworks (e.g. video, film, audio and software-based installations).

Conceived originally as a consensus building project for the three partner museums of the NAT, the enduring goal has been to affirm our commitment to time-based art and artists by developing shared practices for the works’ care and preservation. It has always been the consortium’s hope that if the three museums could come together to agree on emerging stewardship practices, then by sharing these practices online they would be used, improved upon and refined by larger audiences of artists and collectors.
