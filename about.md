## Project History

Launched in 2005, this collaborative project between the New Art Trust (NAT) and its partner museums – the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) and Tate – has been designed to help those who collect and keep media artworks (e.g. video, film, audio and software-based installations).

Conceived originally as a consensus building project for the three partner museums of the NAT, the enduring goal has been to affirm our commitment to media art and artists by developing shared practices for the works’ care and preservation. It has always been the consortium’s hope that if the three museums could come together to agree on emerging stewardship practices, then by sharing these practices online they would be used, improved upon and refined by larger audiences of artists and collectors.

## Contribution Guidelines

_While we refine the site, we welcome any and all feedback you may have. Please take a moment to fill out our <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/kfPsM8tcic">survey</a> to help us further improve the website._

The Matters in Media Art website follows the essential tenets of the [open source philosophy](https://opensource.org/osd). All of the website's source code and content are openly accessible in a repository hosted on GitHub, which offers a framework for anyone to suggest, discuss, and contribute edits to mattersinmediaart.org's content and/or design and functionality.

Fundamental to this open source approach is the licensing that we have chosen to adopt. All mattersinmediaart.org source code is licensed under the [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), and all intellectual content (unless otherwise noted) is licensed under the Creative Commons [Attribution 4.0 International](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license. While these two licenses are quite different from each other, generally speaking, this means that all mattersinmediaart.org content and source code is free to copy, share, adopt, reuse, and redistribute.

### Contributing

We welcome input, feedback, and contributions to mattersinmediaart.org from anyone with a passionate interest in the topic. Contributing to mattersinmediaart.org does not necessarily require any specific level of technical expertise, as there are two different ways of contributing, one of which is incredibly easy!

The first and easiest way of contributing is to do what is called "filing an issue" [on our GitHub page](https://github.com/matters-in-media-art/mattersinmediart.org/issues). GitHub issues can be used to talk about errors or problems with content or functionality, and gives us a place to have a dialog about the problem. [Here is a guide on how to file issues on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/).

The second way of contributing to mattersinmediaart.org is to actually edit the website's content or source code, and then submit this edit for consideration through what GitHub calls a "pull request". [Here is a guide on how to submit pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

<!--

make a note about how we are accepting pull requests, but not new repo admins at the moment
