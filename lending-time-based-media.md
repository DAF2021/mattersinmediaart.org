The process diagram and documents for loans are guidelines and templates for owners to follow when borrowing and lending time-based media. The documents include sample templates for exhibition budgets, condition reports, facilities reports, installation documents and loan agreements. They seek to update existing practice for more traditional art by incorporating new requirements of time-based media.

These resources should be used as reference documents when considering the loan of time-based media works of art and in conjunction with the process diagram. The sample forms and other materials contained on this site are provided as examples only, and do not constitute legal advice. Before using these or any forms, you should consult with legal counsel to ensure that the document is properly tailored to your institution’s particular concerns.

## Explore, compile and review
The key to successful implementation is thorough planning. As a borrower, your first steps are to create a list of works under consideration, and identify sources of information about the works. The following checklist should give the potential borrower a good indication of whether they can install, manage and maintain the work.

With this information, you can now <a href="{{ site.url }}/downloads/loanbudgetcostassessmenttemplate.xls">create a draft budget</a>, review, and make a decision as to whether you wish to proceed with the request or stop.

## Request, consider, approve
Here the lender and the borrower come together to consider a particular request. The main areas of discussion are often the nature of the work and associated costs. Not all requests are accepted and successful requests often include some degree of negotiation. The resulting loan agreement is the document outlining the agreed-upon terms of the loan.

## Send, install and return 
The following checklist of actions is a guide for the borrower and the lender in the implementation of the loan and generally includes the following:

###Borrower

<ul class="collapsible" data-collapsible="accordion">

<li>
  <div class="collapsible-header">Insure/ship</div>
  <div class="collapsible-body" markdown="1">
* Some elements of a time-based media installation are mass-produced or copies and may be easily replaceable but this should not be assumed.
* In some cases it may be very difficult to provide replacements because the master may have been lost or a piece of equipment is obsolete or rare.
* Other components may have been modified by the artist or be sculptural objects.
* Make sure you understand the status of the components being insured and shipped .
</div>
</li>

<li>
  <div class="collapsible-header">Check display equipment</div>
  <div class="collapsible-body" markdown="1">
* The standards required for display of time-based media works of art are higher than required in an office or domestic setting.
* It is important that someone with the relevant expertise check the performance of the display equipment (hired or purchased) well in advance of the display.
* Testing should mirror the display as closely as possible (eg size of image, lighting conditions).
</div>
</li>

<li>
  <div class="collapsible-header">Construct space</div>
  <div class="collapsible-body" markdown="1">
* Many time-based media installations require light-lock corridors, false ceilings and other forms of construction.
* Scale drawings are invaluable.
* Always check real measurements of the gallery space as small inaccuracies can have a large impact on an installation.
</div>
</li>

<li>
  <div class="collapsible-header">Check acoustics</div>
  <div class="collapsible-body" markdown="1">
* Some artists specify the acoustic requirements of the installation very precisely.
* You may need to make adjustments depending on what is being shown in the adjacent spaces.
* Carpet, acoustic panelling, and corridors between spaces all help to cut down sound spill.
* Professional advice from an acoustic engineer may be necessary in complex or tightly specified situations.
</div>
</li>

<li>
  <div class="collapsible-header">Install</div>
  <div class="collapsible-body" markdown="1">
* Hold a meeting with interested parties to sign off the installation once it is completed.

Those monitoring the work whilst on display will need to know:
* The appearance of the work when it is operating correctly, and how to recognise faults
* The reporting procedure for faults
* The procedures for switching the work on and off
</div>
</li>

<li>
  <div class="collapsible-header">Maintain</div>
  <div class="collapsible-body" markdown="1">
* Time-based media installations are dynamic systems which need to be maintained in order to minimise the risk of failure.
* Purchase all elements which need to be replaced regularly (filters, lamps etc) prior to display.
* Establish a schedule and a team of people trained to carry out basic maintenance. It is valuable to keep a log of such work throughout an exhibition.
* Complete and update installation documentation
* Check whether the lender has requested any photographs or documentation as part of the loan agreement.

<section id="budget" class="section scrollspy" markdown="1">

## Budget Guidelines

The categories listed below give some indication of the likely costs to be considered. The aim of this section is to identify the true costs of loan for the borrower and the lender. A sample template is provided as an Excel download.

In most cases the borrower will bear the transport, installation and maintenance costs associated with the loan. However, some costs may be associated with the preparation of the work of art for loan. For example there may be conservation costs, servicing costs associated with any equipment to be lent, or costs of the production of new exhibition format material. The lender will wish to identify these costs and either negotiate with the borrower over contributing to these costs as a condition of loan or agree to meet them themselves.

The earlier in the process costs can be identified, the greater the likelihood of the successful completion of the loan. The budget template aims to provide useful prompts and we encourage users to copy and modify it. As discussions and negotiations regarding the loan progress it will be possible to add more detail to the budget. Every loan situation is unique and you may find that the budget is finalised earlier or later in the process than shown in the process diagram.

## Loan Agreement

The Loan Agreement is a contract between a lender and a borrower. It specifies what is to be lent, the conditions of loan and the respective responsibilities of each party. A covering letter may also be issued with the agreement which draws attention to particularly important conditions of loan. The loan agreement (may also be called a lender’s agreement, borrower’s agreement or loan contract) should be final. 


<ul class="collapsible" data-collapsible="accordion">

<li>
  <div class="collapsible-header">Application period</div>
  <div class="collapsible-body" markdown="1">
* This period is to have been agreed beforehand.
* Confirmation of pre-loan discussion is a condition and part of the application for the loan. See installation documentation and facilities report guidelines.
* Each institution should agree to this period of time. As a guideline, larger institutions require a period of between six and twelve months.

<section id="facilities-report" class="section scrollspy" markdown="1">

## Facilities report

A facilities report outlines an institution’s facilities, climate, security, staffing, insurance and loan history. Examples of standard facilities reports are to be found on the websites of the registrars groups listed in the External resources section. Most institutions have a completed report on file which has been verified by a registrar. The purpose of this document is to assure a lender that the borrower has a history of professional and responsible care of museum artefacts. It is often required by a lender in the early stages of a loan request to determine if the borrower’s facilities are appropriate. Further dialogue may then be initiated between the lending and borrowing institutions to discuss the specific needs of a particular artwork. The installation and maintenance of time-based media works of art requires specific skills and expertise, we are therefore suggesting that it might be useful to attach an addendum to the standard facilities report asking questions specific to time-based media works. The purpose of these guidelines is to gauge the suitability and level of expertise of the borrowing institution with regard to the specific needs of time-based media works.

<section id="documentation" class="section scrollspy" markdown="1">

## Installation Documentation Guidelines

The installation documentation is produced by the owner and accompanies the loan. The installation documentation for time-based media works of art is ideally agreed with the artist when a work is acquired. This project assumes that the artist’s views have been recorded prior to loan and are able to guide the lender and the borrower in honouring what is important for a good installation of the work. When this is not the case, the loan may provide an occasion for dialogue and documentation. It may be part of the nature of the work that there are different ways in which it can be installed and this should be indicated in the installation documentation. In some cases the installation documentation will have evolved through an ongoing dialogue between the owner and the artist. The installation of the work provides an opportunity to add to the documentation. This is a live document with room for evolution.

The goal of this document is to provide a basic framework to help understand all of the elements required for the successful installation of time-based media works of art and to maintain their integrity. Some artworks require rigid and specific installation instructions. Other works allow for more flexibility within the installation. In putting together installation documentation, consider what you would need to know if you were coming fresh to this work for the first time. We have also provided a sample template.

### Artwork description

A brief description of the artwork using standard terminology. The goal is to enable a reader to quickly understand the nature of the artwork. (For example: a 35-minute, 4-channel, colour video installation with stereo sound). It is also helpful to describe how the work appears if working properly.

### Installation ingredients

This represents a comprehensive list of all physical components that make up the installed artwork. This would cover the details of the exhibition format, the equipment list, the details of the installation space and materials required for the installation and any spares or consumables needed to keep the installation running.


<ul class="collapsible" data-collapsible="accordion">

<li>
  <div class="collapsible-header">Exhibition format details</div>
  <div class="collapsible-body" markdown="1">
Enter details of the exhibition format and its duration. Some things to consider:

* Is the material looped? Is the loop intended to be seamless? If not, what is the duration of black on the loop?
* If the work comprises more than one channel, are the channels synchronised?
* What is the availability of spares? Who is authorised to produce spares?
* For film, slide and tapes how often should these be replaced with new copies?
</div>
</li>

<li>
  <div class="collapsible-header">DVDs</div>
  <div class="collapsible-body" markdown="1">
* Is the video NTSC or PAL? It is often not appropriate to change this for a loan as the visual qualities of the two systems are different. However it may affect compatibility with display equipment.
* What type of DVD is it and how was it made? (some players will not play all formats of DVD)
* Is frame accurate searching enabled?
* What is the structure of the disk (Title/chapters etc)?
</div>
</li>

<li>
  <div class="collapsible-header">Audio works</div>

</div>
</li>


</ul>




### Details of the installation space

Produce a scale plan and an elevation and written narrative confirming the details of the installation. Things to consider are:


<ul class="collapsible" data-collapsible="accordion">

<li>
  <div class="collapsible-header">Space</div>
  <div class="collapsible-body" markdown="1">
* Dimensions and shape of the space
* Position of the entrances and exits – including details of any light-lock corridors required.
* Details of the floor and ceiling
* Details of the construction – for example skirting etc.
</div>
</li>

<li>
  <div class="collapsible-header">Elements within the space</div>
  <div class="collapsible-body" markdown="1">

</div>
</li>

<li>
  <div class="collapsible-header">Qualities</div>
  <div class="collapsible-body" markdown="1">

* Equipment cupboard with access and shelving
* Benches
* Plinths
* Special signage
* Exit signs
* Barriers
* High reflective paint
* Screens
</div>
</li>



</ul>




### Spares and consumables

* Enter details of filters, lamps etc. Prior to the installation find out how many hours the lamps and filters last. Manufacturers have data on this. However, these figures are affected by the amount of dust in the space and also how the equipment is switched on and off. Enter the estimated cost into the budget template and ensure that spares are on hand.
* Equipment failure – what spares do you have available if/when this happens? What is the procedure for notifying the lender? What does the borrower have permission to do?

### Key qualities / key requirements

A description of both the specific and ephemeral elements necessary to maintain the integrity of the artwork. Decisions about what constitutes integrity are based on information gathered from the artist and other sources, relating to the essential nature of the artwork and its components. Some things to consider:

* If the artist has said that specific qualities are important (such as light level, sound, wall colours etc) can these be measured to establish a reference
* A non-technical description of what the viewer experiences can often be a valuable guide to installation
* Are there fixed dimensions, such as image size or gallery dimensions?
* Must the equipment be arranged or configured in a specific way?

<ul class="collapsible" data-collapsible="accordion">

<li>
  <div class="collapsible-header">Artist’s statement</div>
