This is a contract between a lender and a borrower. It specifies what is to be lent, the conditions of loan and the respective responsibilities of each party. A covering letter may also be issued with the agreement which draws attention to particularly important conditions of loan.

The loan agreement (may also be called a lender’s agreement, borrower’s agreement or loan contract) should be final. 

## Application period
* This period is to have been agreed beforehand.
* Confirmation of pre-loan discussion is a condition and part of the application for the loan. See installation documentation and facilities report guidelines.
* Each institution should agree to this period of time. As a guideline, larger institutions require a period of between six and twelve months.

## Insurance valuation
* The insurance valuation is based on a distinction between value of art and value of equipment or components lent.

## General conditions
* This is a legal document and specific language should be approved by ‘Lending Institution’s’ legal counsel. In general these are the terms and conditions used by many lending institutions.

## Commercial insurance, indemnity and immunity
* Insurance procedures may vary according to the country ‘Lending Institution’ is located. Depending upon the guidelines of the individual country, some works might need filing from immunity from seizure.

## Loan costs
* Some institutions may charge a loan administration fee. In addition, a depreciation fee may be invoked for replaceable components associated with the loan work.
