The process diagram and documents for loans are guidelines and templates for owners to follow when borrowing and lending time-based media.

The documents include sample templates for exhibition budgets, condition reports, facilities reports, installation documents and loan agreements. They seek to update existing practice for more traditional art by incorporating new requirements of time-based media.

These resources should be used as reference documents when considering the loan of time-based media works of art and in conjunction with the process diagram.

The sample forms and other materials contained on this site are provided as examples only, and do not constitute legal advice. Before using these or any forms, you should consult with legal counsel to ensure that the document is properly tailored to your institution’s particular concerns.

It was beyond the scope of the project at this time to fully address the needs of computer-based art. It is however our aim to turn to this in the future.
