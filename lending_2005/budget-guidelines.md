title: Budget guidelines
---

The categories listed below give some indication of the likely costs to be considered. The aim of this section is to identify the true costs of loan for the borrower and the lender. A sample template is provided as an Excel download.

In most cases the borrower will bear the transport, installation and maintenance costs associated with the loan. However, some costs may be associated with the preparation of the work of art for loan. For example there may be conservation costs, servicing costs associated with any equipment to be lent, or costs of the production of new exhibition format material. The lender will wish to identify these costs and either negotiate with the borrower over contributing to these costs as a condition of loan or agree to meet them themselves.

The earlier in the process costs can be identified, the greater the likelihood of the successful completion of the loan. The budget template aims to provide useful prompts and we encourage users to copy and modify it. As discussions and negotiations regarding the loan progress it will be possible to add more detail to the budget. Every loan situation is unique and you may find that the budget is finalised earlier or later in the process than shown in the process diagram.
