In addition to the above participants this project called on the time and expertise of numerous colleagues around the world and within the participating institutions. We would particularly like to thank Dana Mitroff, Senior Web Manager, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, and Allegra Burnette, Creative Manager for Digital Media, Museum of Modern Art, New York, for their feedback and cooperation regarding the website. Finally we would like to thank Pam and Dick Kramlich and the Directors of the New Art Trust, whose commitment to media art made this project possible.
