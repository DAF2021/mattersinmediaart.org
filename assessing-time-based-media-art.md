![](img/peter-assessing.jpg)

The aim of these guidelines is to extend existing condition reporting practices to include time-based media works of art. A condition report provides the baseline against which future examinations can be compared.

A condition report for time-based media works of art is divided into three sections – the media elements, the equipment and the overall installation. They are different from condition reports for more conventional works of art in that some of the components may be easily replaceable without loss. It is often not possible to know by looking at any component, its value or significance in relation to the identity of the work of art.

<section id="guidelines" class="section scrollspy" markdown="1">
## Overview of Condition Reporting Time-based Media

### Media
In most cases only the exhibition format of the media element will be lent (for example a DVD).
This is made from a master that will be retained by the lender.
It is important to be clear whether the owner will provide new exhibition format material or whether they have an agreement with the artist’s gallery or the artist to oversee this.
It is useful to specify in the conditions of loan that an extra copy of the exhibition format material is to be provided as part of the loan or that the borrower has explicit permission to make one. It is also important to understand what the procedure is for making new copies if needed during the exhibition.

### Equipment

All display equipment will fail and become obsolete. There is a high risk that any equipment you are lent will fail during the course of the exhibition and it is appropriate to plan accordingly.
Some equipment has an aesthetic or conceptual relationship to the identity of the work. The value of such equipment is therefore greater than purely its function. This means that it is important that these relationships are maintained and that it is not possible to substitute this equipment with a different piece of equipment that does not maintain these relationships, without loss.
Installation
No artwork is immune to the circumstances of its presentation. However work of art which are only fully realised in their installed state create a different level of difficulty for issues of authority and authentication than works which form stable static objects. Time-based media works of art are vulnerable to a number of changing conditions that can have a profound impact on how they are understood.
A condition report assesses not only the material condition of the component parts but also whether the installation documentation has been followed and the work has been installed without compromise to the identity of the work.
Some things to consider
It is important to be clear the status of any elements loaned.
Installation documentation is the essential reference document.

There are two fundamental facets of condition reporting for time-based media art: the physical state and the functionality of all the components/elements.
Condition reporting for time-based media may require the expertise of more than one person.
Condition reporting practice
It is important to view, listen to, and experience the entire time-based program and report any deviations from the condition statement.

Condition report layout

A condition report may include the following:

* Basic artwork identification
* Artist
* Title
* Loan reference
* Details of the lender and the exhibition
* Name
* Exhibition title
* Open date
* Close date
* Description
* Describe the work and list the elements/components and how they work together.

### Media
In most cases exhibition format material will be produced for each loan by the lender or by the artist or the artist’s gallery. It is therefore unlikely that you will be condition checking old or archival material.
Where this is not the case the borrower, lender, artist and gallery may need to work closely together to ensure that accurate material is produced from the best available master. This may provide an opportunity to address the long-term conservation of the work.

In all cases it is important to establish:

* Whether the display material has been newly produced for the display.
* If the medium is video is it NTSC, PAL or SECAM? It is often inappropriate to change the nature of the signal as different standards have different aesthetic qualities. However this may create a compatibility problem with some display equipment. Any changes should be discussed with the owner.
* Whether there is an extra copy.
* Whether there are enough copies for the duration of the show, and how often they should be changed. This is particularly important in cases where display causes rapid deterioration, for example slides, film prints and tapes.
* The provenance of exhibition copies. (What have they been produced from and has the artist signed them off?)
* The procedure for requesting additional copies and the cost associated with the production of these copies.

### Film and slide material
* Is the colour, contrast, grading, consistent and correct?
* Is there any evidence of fading?
* Are the slides/film prints clean and unscratched?
* Are slides properly mounted?
* Is there any evidence of moisture damage?
* Are the film prints coated?
* How often does the exhibition copy need to be changed with new copies?

### Video and audio tapes
* Why have you been sent this tape? Is the work to be shown on tape or are you expected to produce additional exhibition copies?
* Does the lender/artist or artist’s representative need to approve any exhibition copies produced?
* What is the status of the material (master/sub-master etc) and what are the responsibilities of the borrower in relation to it?
* Does the tape appear to be in good condition (rewound, no signs of creasing or damage)?
* Does the quality of the exhibition copy reflect the quality of the master?
* Check for defects in the image and/or the sound.

### Optical discs
* Are the discs free from scratches?
* Are the discs free from finger prints and dust?
* Is there any evidence of delaminating?
* Are the discs free from warping?
* Do the discs play correctly and loop etc as required?
* Is the quality of the encoding accurate and free from errors?
* Check for defects in the image and the sound.

### Hard-disc drives
* What is the configuration of the disc(s)? (Raid array etc)
* How are the discs formatted (FAT32, NTFS etc).
* What is the operating system?
* What additional software is loaded?
* What are the file names, encoding, and location of the media files?
* What are the makes, models and specifications of the media cards?
* What connectors are available for the display devices?
* How are the audio and video signals output (check compatibility with display devices)?
* What is the nature of the back up of the files etc and where are they located?
* Are any passwords required?

### Sculptural element
* It is beyond the scope of this project to cover condition checking guidelines for sculpture.
* However, sculptural elements of a time-based media installation should be handled and condition checked in the same way as other loaned sculptures.
* Display equipment 

### Status
* Is the identity of the work of art linked to a particular make and model?
* Is the equipment intended to be visible? Is the look of the original make and model therefore important?
* Is the equipment now obsolete and rare?
* Has the equipment been modified by the artist?
* Is there a spare?
* What is the procedure should the equipment fail?

### Condition
* Is the equipment in full working order?
* Is there evidence of any external damage?
* Are all accessories present and checked off? (Remote control, operations manual etc)
* Is the packing adequate?
* Do you have a record of the hours it has been operational? (This information is available in the menus of many projectors).
* Is the equipment clean?
* Has it been maintained?
* What is the fire risk created by this equipment? (Describe any safeguards taken).

### Projectors and monitors
* Although other technologies are available the most common are cathode ray tube (CRT) and liquid crystal display (LCD) projectors and monitors.
* To check a projector it is advisable to project the image at the size required for the work.

### Liquid crystal display
* Project a white field and a black field and check for faulty pixels.
* View a white field and check that the white balance is even and there is no discolouration in part of the image.
* View a black field to check for dust spots.
* View a grid and check for convergence of red, green and blue.
* View colour bars and check the colour rendition.
* Check the filters are clean (projectors only).
* Check the age of the lamp (may be difficult to ascertain for monitors).

### Cathode ray tubes
* Project a white field and check for burn-in on the Cathode Ray tubes.
* Check a white field for brightness and colour balance.
* Check the number of hours that the tubes have been used.
* Project a black field and check for dust.
* View colour bars and check the colour rendition.
* Check the focus and the accuracy of the convergence using a grid or dot pattern (projectors only).
* Has the installation been installed correctly?
* Were the specifications accurately fulfilled?

### Some things to consider:
* Space and construction requirements
* How the public encounters the work/enters the space.
* Lighting and acoustic requirements.
* Operation and functionality (including timing).
* Was the sound and image accurately rendered?
* Where any changes necessary during installation or during the course of the show?

### Video
![](img/peter-assessing.jpg)

<span class="flow-text">
Assessing your digital video media is a crucial step on entering your collection. Not only will it help you to understand the technical characteristics and anomalies of the file(s), it will help you create a baseline against which future examinations can be compared, and generally gain a better understanding of each artwork and your collection as a whole. 
</span>

Video files are assessed and condition checked both visually and aurally with the appropriate tools. This section covers the design requirements of a work station, approaches to running initial technical analysis on your file(s), the visual and aural technical assessment and its documentation.

###	 Assessment Workstation

To assess, quality-control and condition report your digital video files, you might want to consider designing a workstation that is customized to your needs and dedicated to these video evaluating activities. Below you will find three examples of workstations that serve various budgets and are aimed at different levels of quality-control. The three tiers outlined are designed to serve both standard definition (SD) and high definition (HD) video systems. If you are working exclusively with either SD or HD material, you could make savings by acquiring just the tools for your specific needs. The following aspects are the 7 key components relevant to all digital video assessment workstations.  

<ul class="collapsible" data-collapsible="accordion">
<li>
  <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">settings_input_composite</i>Connection Types</div>
  <div class="collapsible-body">
  	<p>
  		Since the signal connections of your devices will play an important role in the playback of your video files, these will be briefly described together with their commonly associated formats. It is important to note that many analog formats only support 1 signal type and therefore outputting them on a “better” (or more recent) signal type can actually change the authenticity of the signal. Keeping the signal native is has been referred to as transparent migration. 
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		Composite Video [analog connection, SD]: All the information that composes the signal, luminance, chrominance, blanking and synchronization (CVBS), is merged together into one signal. Composite video is a single connection type (either BNC or RCA). Analog formats that utilize a composite signal output and are recorded using a composite signal include ½” open-reel, ¾” U-matic, laser disc and VHS.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		S-Video or Y/C [analog connection, SD]: As opposed to the composite signal, S-Video separates the luminance (Y) and the chrominance (C) into two different channels. Thereby it is a step up in quality from the composite video. It is transmitted by a distinctive looking, 4-pin connector. Formats that allowed for Y/C include VHS and DVD.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		Component Video [analog connection, SD]: Component video is the best quality connection to transmit analog video signals. The signal is separated into three channels: Y (luminance), Pb (Blue minus L) and Pr (Red minus L). The green is derived using the pythagoreon theorem. Component video comes as three adjoined plugs, sometimes color-coded to green (Y), blue (Pb) and red (Pr). This connection should be used on analog Betacam and Betacam SP.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		Serial Digital Interface [SDI, SD or HD]. The SDI signal is a digital bit stream that can be used to transmit analog and digital video signals, and has also been used to by digital formats to record the signal to tape (Digital Betacam). SD-SDI is a signal connection type, using the BNC connection type, that packages the video, aural, and any ancillary data (timecode, closed captioning, etc) into a signal bit stream for transmission. SD-SDI is a 4:2:2 YUV system of video transmission. HD-SDI uses the same principal but splits the signal amongst multiple connections to increase the bandwidth necessary for transmission of High Definition material.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		High Definition Multimedia Interface [HDMI]: HDMI is typically used in the connection of monitors and other devices together in the transmission of high definition material.
  	</p>

  <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">settings_overscan</i>Monitor</div>
  <div class="collapsible-body">
  	<p>
  		For standard definition video files –for example videos that come from SD tape transfers–, watching the video on a Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) monitor is crucial, as only these monitors will show you both fields of the interlaced content and provide you with an authentic display of the video signal. CRT monitors are no longer manufactured, however they can be found through appropriate web platforms (eg. eBay) or forums who post when Broadcast studios sell off their equipment. Make sure the video inputs fit your system before you buy it, and calibration is recommended when setting up.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  	Viewing interlaced video files on a computer monitor is problematic because these monitors cannot display interlaced footage and will attempt to merge the fields together into discrete frames. Certain errors, e.g. a head clog from a tape digitization, can only affect one field and lead to a complete area of image loss, which you would not see on a computer monitor.</p>
  	<p>
  	With the advent of high definition video, the term progressive entered the video world. Progressive means that a video –just like film– contains full discrete frames, as opposed to the two-fields interlaced. Progressive video content is often indicated by a lower case p, for example 720p. These videos can be quality-controlled easily on a computer monitor. A more advanced approach for viewing these kinds of files would be a color-calibrated, LCD studio monitor.

  <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">settings</i>Computer</div>
  <div class="collapsible-body">
  	<p>Watching digital videos, especially uncompressed, can be challenging for older or regular “desktop”-computers. Your workstation requires a relatively powerful computer, with a minimum of several GB of RAM. Most videos will lag, if you play them directly from external hard drives, depending on your interface, and from servers, depending on your connection; therefore it is good practice to save them locally for assessment requiring sufficient storage space on your computer. Alternatively you could consider an external hard drive or RAID with a fast interface connection. The platform you choose –Mac or PC– depends on the kind of software to be used: Final Cut Pro only works on Macs, whereas Adobe Premiere is available for both platforms. Make sure to choose your computer platform depending on your software and hardware needs and compatibilities.</p>

  <div class="collapsible-body">
  	<p>Monitors, even when calibrated, are inherently subjective in how they represent the visual information. Oscilloscopes provide an objective view of the signal by providing access to the luminance and chrominance electronic information. The two critical scopes for the assessment of both analog and digital video are a waveform monitor and a vectorscope.

Waveform Monitor: [IMAGE]
The waveform monitor measures the luminance (black and white) information of the video signal. A graticule is used to plot the information on a scale and allows one to see whether the blacks are too low in the signal (which may disrupt sync in an analog system) or the whites are two high (which would allow visual confirmation that the whites are “blown out” or exceed 100 IRE).
Vectorscope: [IMAGE]The vectorscope is a 360 degree color wheel that measures the hue and saturation of the chrominance information in the video signal. Known references like fleshtone, blue sky, etc. can be used to discern whether the chrominance information is being represented faithfully.</p>

<li>
  <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">perm_device_information</i>Software</div>
  <div class="collapsible-body">
  	<p>Software is crucial in the assessment of your digital video material. It is important to understand the basics of the software and how it functions to know whether your video is being processed and faithfully represented. Typically, capture and editing software like Blackmagic’s Media Express, Adobe Premiere and Final Cut Pro X can be used to analyze the discrete portions of your video material and allows for an in-depth assessment of its basic characteristics (luminance, chrominance and audio). Free tools such as QCtools (REF) also allow for in-depth assessment of your video files and have been developed for the archiving community.</p>

  	<p>[IMAGE OF MONITORS AND METERS]
Quality audio monitors and meters are also necessary in the assessment of video material. A pair of studio grade, near-field speakers is recommended for listening to a piece. In addition, audio scopes using either the decibel (dB) or volume unit (VU) method of measurement are useful in looking at whether the audio is clipped, compressed or otherwise distorted, and for measuring whether the audio is in phase or not. http://www.sweetwater.com/insync/phase-2/ </p>

###	Initial Technical Analysis
The amount of technical information that you might receive with a digital video artwork will vary depending on the artist.

File Characteristics
These are the key characteristics of the file that you will ideally want to have prior to receiving the the digital video. If this is not possible, the following aspects should examined on receiving the files:

* What is the file wrapper? e.g. mov, mp4, avi, etc.
* What is your codec? e.g Apple Pro Res 4:2:2, Uncompressed, H.264
* What is the video resolution? e.g 1080 x 1920, 480 x 720, 576 x 720, etc.
* What is the aspect ratio? 16:9, 4:3, etc.  
* What is the chroma subsampling?: e.g. 422, 4444, etc.
* Is the file interlaced or progressive?
* What is the audio codec? e.g. PCM, AAC, etc.

#### Environment Characteristics

Before assessing digital video files, it is incredibly helpful to first have a better understanding of the environment, ie. the software and hardware systems used for production of the video, as these can be useful in confirming assessment and/or diagnosing errors. This information will help inform both the accurate assessment of the video material as well as how to best care for it in the future. The following information is useful to have from the artist, if possible before assessment.  

Sample questions
* How was the work shot, or what were the sources?
* How was the work edited? e.g Final Cut Pro 7.0.7, Adobe Premiere Pro CC
* If possible, could you provide your project file or XML output of it?
* What playback environment did you use when viewing your piece? e.g. Mac Pro running OS X 10.9, PC Tower running Windows 8, etc.
* What software do you typically use when checking/viewing your files? e.g. Quicktime 7, Quicktime X, VLC, etc.

Display Characteristics

As with any media-based artwork, it is useful to review an artists display specifications, if possible. 

Technical Assessment

Depending on your workflow you may carry out a technical assessment before you condition check the duration of your digital video file. The purpose of this assessment is to expose and document the following characteristics as well as ensure that they remain unchanged by any processing carried out.

* Aspect Ratio
* Pixel format (non-square versus square)
* Color matrices and spaces
* Frame size (resolution) 
* Interlacement versus progressive 
* YUV sample range
* Timecode
* Frame Rate
* Duration
* Audio Channel Arrangement (channel count, assignment) subtitles

Assessing files: What to look for:
* Confirming that the content is as expected (see sample questions). 
* That there are no obvious technical problems with the streams.
* That there is no conflicting information between the streams and the wrapper. For example, a particular combination of stream(s) and     wrapper may provide ambiguous instructions for decoding, leaving the possibility that different players might play back the video        stream differently. If this is the case it is helpful to clarify with the artist or their representative, if at all possible. 
* That this is not an of absence of key information in the streams and the wrapper.
* Confirm that the basic matches content matches what was expected from the artist, for example the codec, the wrapper, audio sample rate and bit¬depth,   subsampling, frame rate and the duration.

Assessing files: How to:
* Run MediaInfo (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaInfo) on your file(s) to expose the technical metadata for analysis:

          MAC Users:
          * Open Terminal
          * Run MediaInfo on the video files you are about to assess command: mediainfo ¬f [path to input file]
          * It will look something like this:
 
          PC Users:
          * Run MediaInfo with the following command it will look something like this:

Assessing files: Identifying Technical Problems

Integrity  
This step is to confirm that the files integrity is intact and there are no obvious signs that the file is incomplete or corrupted. The first method of checking the integrity of the file is to confirm that the file checksum associated with the file, if supplied with the artist on receipt, validates when transferred or moved to your storage infrastructure. If the checksum does not validate, this is a clear sign that something technically has changed within the file. The second method of checking the file integrity is to analyze the MediaInfo report for clear indicators of technical problems. These can vary, but an example is a file that will not open in any player and the mediainfo report looks like the image below (insert image):
 
 
By analyzing this report, it becomes clear that the file is incomplete and lacks the video and audio streams necessary for playback as the MediaInfo report finishes without displaying the video or audio stream technical metadata. This makes it clear that this information is not present in the file and is the reason for its inability to be displayed. This is a critical error with the file and will necessitate replacement.

Conflicts in Wrapper versus Streams
Problems might arise in the consistent playback of a video stream with regards to aspect ratio and colour interpretation if there is conflicting metadata held in the wrapper and the stream. For example:

Video
ID/String                                : 1
Format                                   : AVC
Format/Info                              : Advanced Video Codec
Format_Profile                           : Main@L4.0
Format_Settings_CABAC/String             : No
Format_Settings_RefFrames/String         : 2 frames
Format_Settings_GOP                      : M=1, N=50
CodecID                                  : avc1
CodecID/Info                             : Advanced Video Coding
Duration/String                          : 2mn 57s
BitRate/String                           : 4 925 Kbps
Width/String                             : 1 920 pixels
Height/String                            : 1 080 pixels
DisplayAspectRatio/String                : 16:9
FrameRate_Mode/String                    : Constant
FrameRate/String                         : 25.000 fps
ColorSpace                               : YUV
ChromaSubsampling                        : 4:2:0
BitDepth/String                          : 8 bits
ScanType/String                          : Progressive
Bits¬(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.095
StreamSize/String                        : 104 MiB (98%)
Language/String                          : English
Encoded_Date                             : UTC 2014¬03¬27 11:47:51 Tagged_Date                : UTC 2014¬03¬27 11:55:51
colour_primaries                         : BT.709 
transfer_characteristics                 : BT.709 
matrix_coefficients                      : BT.601 colour_range                                                      
                                         : Limited

In this example, the 3 fields to look at are:
* color primaries
* transfer_characteristics 
* matrix_coefficients
There is a conflict in the subsampling between the “color_primaries” and the “matrix_coefficient” where the file contains decoding information that relates to 2 very different color spaces, BT.709 and BT.601. This conflict would expose itself if played back in Quicktime where the player would default to BT.601, which is the incorrect colorspace.

Identifying Absence of Key Information avi/ uncompressed problem

aspect ratio information ¬ not captured in ffv1 and mkv

visual check : choppy ¬ field dominance issues

Poor quality or accuracy of colour data ¬ chroma subsampling upscaling issues

Things to document to make sure you display it properly:

full range and broadcast range resolution and interpolation Display Aspect Ratio (DAR)
