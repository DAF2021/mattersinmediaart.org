Assessing your video files is a crucial step when they enter your collection. Not only will it help you to understand what codecs and formats you’re dealing with, but also it is necessary to identify possible errors or inaccuracies within the digital video, like encoding glitches, wrong aspect ratios, or generally a codec used that does not fit your preservation policy.

When conducting this assessment, it is helpful to work with a Condition Report which will walk you through all the steps. This could either be a PDF form or a sheet incorporated in your database. An example template can be downloaded here.

In this section you will find four components of an assessment workflow and also details of how to set up an assessment workstation. The components of an assessment workflow are:

* Visual and Aural Assessment
* Initial Diagnostics
* Technical Assessment 
* Assessment Documentation

Some people will carry out all assessment before ingest into a digital repository, others will choose to ingest the material provided by the artist into their repository and then carry out a full assessment.

##	 Assessment Workstation
To assess, quality-control and condition report your digital video files, you might want to consider designing a workstation that is customized to your needs and dedicated to these video evaluating activities. Below you will find three examples of workstations that serve various budgets and are aimed at different levels of quality-control. The three tiers outlined are designed to serve both standard definition and high definition video systems. If you are working exclusively with either SD or HD material, different, more customized, and maybe even more economic solutions can be found. 
Before going into specific equipment, we are going to describe a few standard features that are applicable to all examples.

<ul class="collapsible" data-collapsible="accordion">
<li>
  <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">settings_input_composite</i>Connection Types</div>
  <div class="collapsible-body">
  	<p>
  		Since the signal connections of your devices will play an important role in the playback of your video files, we’ll briefly describe what is available and make some recommendations. It is important to note that many analog formats only support 1 signal type and therefore outputting them on a “better” signal type can actually change the authenticity of the signal.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		Composite Video [analog connection, SD]: All the information that composes the signal, luminance, chrominance, blanking and synchronization (CVBS), is merged together into one signal. Composite video is a single connection type (either BnC or RCA). Analog formats that utilize a composite signal output and are recorded using a composite signal are ½” open-reel, ¾” U-matic and VHS.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		S-Video or Y/C [analog connection, SD]: As opposed to the composite signal, S-Video separates the luminance (Y) and the chrominance (C) into two different channels. Thereby it is a step up in quality from the composite video. It is transmitted by a distinctive looking, 4 pin plug. Formats that allowed for Y/C [ADD].
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		Component Video [analog connection, SD]: Component video is the best quality connection to transmit analog video signals. The signal is separated into three channels: Y (luminance), Pb (Blue minus L) and Pr (Red minus L). The green is derived using the pythagoreon theorem. Component video comes as three adjoined plugs, sometimes color-coded to green (Y), blue (Pb) and red (Pr). This connection should be used on analog Betacam and Betacam SP.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		Serial Digital Interface [SDI, SD or HD]. The SDI signal is a digital bit stream that is either used to transmit analog and digital video signals as well as used by many digital formats to record the signal to tape (Digibeta). SD-SDI is a signal connection type, using the BnC connection type, that packages the video, aural and any ancillary data (timecode, closed captioning, etc) into a signal bit stream for transmission. SD SDI is a 4:2:2 YUV system of video transmission. HD-SDI uses the same principal but splits the signal amongst multiple connections to increase the bandwidth necessary for transmission of High Definition material.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		High Definition Multimedia Interface [HDMI]: HDMI is typically used in the connection of monitors and other devices together in the transmission of high definition material.

  <div class="collapsible-body">
  	<p>
  		For standard definition video files –for example videos that come from SD tape transfers–, watching the video on a CRT monitor is crucial, as only these monitors will show you both fields of the interlaced content and provide you an authentic display of the video signal. Since CRT monitors are not fabricated anymore today, you’ll most likely have to scout appropriate web platforms (eg. eBay) or watch for a garage sale of a nearby Broadcast studio getting rid of their equipment. Make sure the video inputs fit your system before you buy it, and have it calibrated for best use.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  	Viewing interlaced video files on a computer monitor is problematic because these monitors cannot display interlaced footage and will attempt to merge the fields together into discrete frames. Certain errors, e.g. a head clog from a tape digitization, can only affect one field and lead to complete image loss, which you would not see on a computer monitor.</p>
  	<p>
  	With high definition video, the term progressive entered the video world. Progressive means that a video –just like film– contains full frames, as opposed to the two-fields interlaced. This is often indicated by a lower case p, like 720p. These videos can be quality-controlled easily on a computer monitor. A more advanced approach for viewing these kinds of files would be a color-calibrated, LCD studio monitor.

  <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">settings</i>Computer</div>
  <div class="collapsible-body">
  	<p>Watching digital videos, especially compressed ones, can be challenging for older or regular “desktop”-computers. For your workstation you would want quite a powerful computer, with at least several GB of RAM. Most videos will lag, if you play them off of external hard drives, depending on your interface, or off of servers, depending on your connection; it is thereby often necessary to save them locally, which requires enough storage space on your computer. Alternatively you could consider an external hard drive or RAID with a fast enough interface connection. The platform you choose –Mac or PC– depends on the kind of software you’d like to use: Final Cut Pro only works on Macs, whereas Adobe Premiere is available for both platforms. Make sure to choose your computer platform depending on your software and hardware needs and compatibilities.</p>

  <div class="collapsible-body">
  	<p>Monitors that display visual information, even when calibrated, are inherently subjective in how they represent the visual information. Oscilloscopes provide an objective view of the signal by providing access to the luminance and chrominance electronic information. The two critical scopes for the assessment of both analog and digital video are a waveform monitor and a vectorscope.

Waveform Monitor: [IMAGE]The waveform monitor allows you to measure the luminance
(black and white) information of the video signal. A graticule is used to plot the information on a scale and allows one to see whether the black are too low in the signal (which may disrupt sync in an analog system) or the whites are two high (which would allow visual confirmation that the whites are “blown out” or exceed 100 IRE).
Vectorscope: [IMAGE]The vectorscope is a 360 degree color wheel that allows one to measure the hue and saturation of the chrominance information in the video signal. Known references like fleshtone, blue sky, etc can be used to see whether the chrominance information is being represented faithfully or may warrant re-transfer or processing done by a processing amplifier.</p>

  <div class="collapsible-header"><i class="material-icons">perm_device_information</i>Software</div>
  <div class="collapsible-body">
  	<p>Software is crucial in the assessment of your digital video material. It’s important to understand the basics of the software and how it functions to know whether your video is being processed and faithfully represented. Typically, capture and editing software like Blackmagic’s Media Express, Adobe Premiere and Final Cut Pro X can be used to analyze the discrete portions of your video material and allows for an in-depth assessment of its basic characteristics (luminance, chrominance and audio). Free tools such as QCtools (REF) also allow for in depth assessment of your video files and have been developed for the archiving community.</p>

Quality audio monitors and meters are also necessary in the assessment of video material. A pair of studio grade, near-field speakers is recommended for close listening to a piece. In addition, audio scopes using either the db or vu method of measurement are useful in looking at whether the audio is clipped, compressed or otherwise distorted as well as measuring whether the audio is in phase or not.</p>

##	Initial Diagnostics
The amount of technical information that you might receive with a digital video artwork will vary depending on how technical the artist is or how good their technical support is.

Before you can properly assess the digital video files either in your collection or during the acquisition process, you first need to have a better understanding of the environment, ie. the software and hardware system used for production and playback, and the way the video was produced. This information will help inform both the accurate assessment of the video material as well as how to best care for it in the future.

File Characteristics
These are the key characteristics of the file that you will want to have prior to receiving the video elements for acquisition:

File Characteristics:

* What is the file wrapper? e.g. mov, mp4, avi, etc.
* What is your codec? e.g Apple Pro Res 4:2:2, Uncompressed, H.264
* What is the video resolution? e.g 1080 x 1920, 480 X 720, 576 X 720, etc.
* What is the aspect ratio? 16:9, 4:3, etc.  
* What is the chroma subsampling?: e.g. 422, 4444, etc.
* Is the file interlaced or progressive?
* What is the audio codec? e.g. PCM, AAC, etc.
* What file format(s) have you used for exhibition? e.g same as above, h264 What is the audio? e.g mono, stereo, surround 5.1

Where possible, to facilitate the accurate delivery of this information, ideally the artist or their representative would do the following:

FOR MACS:

1. Open VLC and playback your video. Go to Window>Media Information
2. Select second tab: “Codec Details”

4/30/2015 https://sites.google.com/a/moma.org/mma3/developing-your-systems/prepare-your-collection/2-assessment/initial-diagnostics?tmpl=%2Fsystem%2Fapp%2Fte…

FOR WINDOWS:

1. Open VLC and playback your video.
2. Go to Tools>Media Information
3. Select third tab: “Codec”
4. Expand All Streams
5. It should look like the image below.

[INSERT SCREEN SHOT]
You should  then advise the artist or representative to view the file in VLC and confirm that the above characteristics are present and the file looks accurate.
Environment Characteristics
Having information about the environment of creation (i.e. the software and hardware used) can be useful in confirming assessment and/or diagnosing errors.
4/30/2015 https://sites.google.com/a/moma.org/mma3/developing-your-systems/prepare-your-collection/2-assessment/initial-diagnostics?tmpl=%2Fsystem%2Fapp%2Fte…

How was the work edited? e.g Final Cut Pro 7.0.7, Adobe Premiere Pro CC
 If possible, could you provide your project file or XML output of it?
What playback environment did you use when viewing your piece? e.g. Mac Pro running OS X 10.9, PC Tower running Windows 8, etc.
What software do you typically use when checking/viewing your files? e.g. Quicktime 7, Quicktime X, VLC, etc.
Display Characteristics
As with any time¬based media artwork, it is useful at this stage to understand any display specifications, for more information see
http://www.tate.org.uk/about/projects/matters¬media¬art/acquisitions/preacquisitions/
At this stage it is useful to understand the artist’s attitude to changes in the appearance of their video artwork over time. For example, changes in display technology (LCD projectors vs DLP projectors, changes in playback devices), color shifts, etc.  
For digital video artworks in particular, this information can prove critical in quantifying the changes that can occur to a file through various playback and display technologies. For example, a particular combination of stream(s) and wrapper may not provide unambiguous instructions for decoding leaving the possibility that different players might play back the video stream differently.
It is helpful to ask if the artist or their representative have experienced any problems with achieving a suitable level of consistent playback for this work, if so please ask them to describe. 

##	Technical Assessment
Depending on your workflow you may carry out a technical assessment before you process your content for ingest into a digital repository or after.
The purpose of this assessment is to expose, document the following characteristics and ensure that they remain unchanged by any processing carried out.
Aspect Ratio
Pixel format
Colour matrices and spaces
Frame size
Interlacement
YUV sample range
Timecode
Frame Rate
Duration
Audio Channel Arrangement (channel count, assignment) subtitles
1. Assessing the files:
There are four main things to analyse the technical metadata of your files for:
confirming that the content is as expected
that there are no obvious technical problems with the streams
that there is no conflicting information between the streams and the wrapper
that this is not an of absence of key information in the streams and the wrapper
To begin the technical assessment of your video files, you first need to run mediainfo on your file(s) to expose the technical metadata for analysis. To do this, follow the below instructions:
MAC:
Open Terminal
run media info on the video files you are about to assess command: mediainfo ¬f [path to input file]
4/30/2015 https://sites.google.com/a/moma.org/mma3/developing-your-systems/prepare-your-collection/2-assessment/technical-assessment?tmpl=%2Fsystem%2Fapp%2…
It will look something like this:
 
On PC: open
run mediainfo with the following command it will look something like this:
Confirm that the basic content is as expected, for example the codec, the wrapper, audio sample rate and bit¬depth, subsampling, frame rate and the duration
Confirmation of Content
 This step in the technical assessment of your video files is to confirm the files you have received match what was expected from the artist or their representative.
4/30/2015 https://sites.google.com/a/moma.org/mma3/developing-your-systems/prepare-your-collection/2-assessment/technical-assessment?tmpl=%2Fsystem%2Fapp%2…
Identifying Obvious Technical Problems
 
This step is to confirm that the files integrity is intact and there are no obvious signs that the file is incomplete or corrupted. The first method of checking the integrity of the file is to confirm that the file checksum associated with the file validates when transferred or moved to your storage infrastructure. If the checksum does not validate, this is a clear sign that something technically has changed within the file. The second method of checking the file integrity to to analyze the mediainfo report for clear indicators of technical problems. These can vary, but an example is a file that will not open and the mediainfo report looks like the image below:
 
 
By analyzing this report, it becomes clear that the file is incomplete and lacks the video and audio streams necessary for playback as mediainfo report finishes without displaying the video or audio stream technical metadata. This makes it clear that this information is not present in the file and is the reason for its inability to be displayed.
This is a critical error with the file and will necessitate replacement.

Identifying Technical Conflicts in Wrapper versus Streams
Problems might arise in the consistent playback of a video stream with regards to aspect ratio and colour interpretation if there is conflicting metadata held in the wrapper and the stream.

In this example, the 3 fields to look at are “color primaries”, “transfer_characteristics” and “matrix_coefficients”. There is a conflict in the subsampling between the “color primaries” and the “matrix_coefficient” where the file contains decoding information that relates to 2 very different color spaces. This conflict would expose itself if played back in Quicktime where the player would default to BT.601, which is the incorrect colorspace.
Identifying Absence of Key Information avi/ uncompressed problem
aspect ratio information ¬ not captured in ffv1 and mkv
visual check : choppy ¬ field dominance issues
Poor quality or accuracy of colour data ¬ chroma subsampling upscaling issues
Things to document to make sure you display it properly:
full range and broadcast range resolution and interpolation Display Aspect Ratio (DAR)
