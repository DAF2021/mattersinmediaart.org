Since 2005, the Matters in Media Art project has been providing art collectors, museums, and artists, with guidelines for the collection and long-term care and preservation of time-based artworks.

Conceived originally as a consensus building project for the three partner museums of the New Art Trust (the [MoMA](http://www.moma.org/), the [SFMOMA](http://www.sfmoma.org/) and [Tate](http://www.tate.org.uk/)), the enduring goal has been to affirm our commitment to time-based art and artists by developing shared practices for the works’ care and preservation. It has always been the consortium’s hope that if the three museums could come together to agree on emerging stewardship practices, then by sharing these practices online they would be used, improved upon and refined by larger audiences of artists and collectors.

#### Developing a model for inter-museum exchange
The first two phases of Matters in Media Art on acquisitions and loans, published online in 2005 and 2008, established the project’s track record as a model for inter-museum exchange. In this third phase, it is our aim to expand our content to keep pace with changing demands, not only to reflect new media formats that artists are using today, but also to extend this model for exchange by strengthening and refreshing our connections to other networks of allied research and practice.
