# Matters in Media Art
</div>

<div class="col s12" markdown="1">

Launched in 2005, this collaborative project between the New Art Trust (NAT) and its partner museums – the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) and Tate – has been designed to help those who collect and keep time-based artworks (e.g. video, film, audio and software-based installations).

## A Collaborative Project
Conceived originally as a consensus building project for the three partner museums of the NAT, the enduring goal has been to affirm our commitment to time-based art and artists by developing shared practices for the works’ care and preservation. It has always been the consortium’s hope that if the three museums could come together to agree on emerging stewardship practices, then by sharing these practices online they would be used, improved upon and refined by larger audiences of artists and collectors. 

## Developing a model for inter-museum exchange
The first two phases of Matters in Media Art on acquisitions and loans, published online in 2005 and 2008, established the project’s track record as a model for inter-museum exchange. In this third phase, it is our aim to expand our content to keep pace with changing demands, not only to reflect new media formats that artists are using today, but also to extend this model for exchange by strengthening and refreshing our connections to other networks of allied research and practice.
