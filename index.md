# Matters in Media Art

A snappy intro goes here... Launched in 2005, this collaborative project between the New Art Trust (NAT) and its partner museums – the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (SFMOMA) and Tate – has been designed to help those who collect and keep time-based artworks (e.g. video, film, audio and software-based installations).
