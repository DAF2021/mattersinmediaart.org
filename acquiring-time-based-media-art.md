Because time-based media works require a proactive approach to care and management, the moment of acquisition is critical in gathering information that will ensure their display and care into the future.

The process diagram and documents for the acquisition process are grouped into three overlapping phases: pre-acquisition, accessioning, and post-acquisition. Although these three phases are distinct, knowledge about the artwork continuously builds from the moment it is considered for acquisition to final installation and long-term storage. This knowledge informs future decisions about storing, exhibiting, loaning, and conserving the work.

### The key questions

* What information do I need to make a decision about a possible acquisition?
* How do I anticipate the cost of owning this work?
* What master material and equipment should come with the acquisition?

### About the pre-acquisition phase
![](http://www.tate.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/grid-normal-12-cols/public/images/node/243451.gif?itok=2L9ZjBkV)

The focus of the pre-acquisition phase for time-based media works is deciding whether to acquire the work of art. Information gathered during this phase is used to justify the acquisition and to forecast costs, installation logistics, and conservation concerns for future ownership. This information falls into two main categories, conceptual and technical.

An understanding of the conceptual and technical elements that comprise the work of art is essential for acquisition consideration, but also to the continued viability and authentic presentation of the work. In reality, there is often little time prior to an acquisition to gather all the information in detail. However, you are aiming to gain a general understanding of the areas outlined below.

The information collected during the pre-acquisition phase provides a baseline of knowledge for deeper levels of documentation after the work is acquired.

Prior to acquisition of a time-based media work, the following steps may be taken by a curator or collector.

### What is it? – Get to know the artwork

1. Understand what you are proposing to acquire: what is it?
2. Gather general information: artist, title, date, medium, duration, edition details, provenance, artist’s dates, credit line, display dimensions
3. Understand key qualities of the work and prepare a description of the elements necessary to maintain the integrity of the artwork. This includes:
* Artist statement about the work (from artist, gallery or seller)
* Curatorial/collector statement for importance in collection
* Non-technical description of what the viewer experiences
* Basic installation specifications

### Explore deeper
Based on the artist’s statement and installation instructions, determine the following:

* What are the essential vs. desirable exhibition conditions, including space requirements?
* What can and cannot be changed in the display?
* Can you physically display the work in your exhibition space?

You also need to determine:

* Original master: Where is it? What is the format? Where does it reside? Who owns it?
* Who owns the copyright to the work?
* Acquire reference images that will facilitate the acquisition process (stills or screen grabs, installation photo, exhibition copy, etc.)

### Assemble expertise

* In order to proceed, the curator/collector will need to gather more detailed information relying on the expertise of a larger group of people.
* Large institutions may assemble a team comprising some or all of the following expertise: curatorial, conservation, registration exhibitions, technical/media/audio-visual, IT, legal/intellectual property.
* Collectors and small institutions may find knowledgeable technical support: contact a museum conservation department, art gallery, art consultant, and/or artist/studio to recommend sources.

### Get the details – Identify areas for further inquiry and pursue detailed information
* Once team/resources are established, curator/collector presents the proposed acquisition. The following information may be gathered both internally and externally. Identify one person to be the co-ordinator for this process. In some circumstances, cataloguing the work may begin prior to acquisition (see details in post-acqusition phase).
* Before proceeding with the acquisition, consider the key questions at the head of each section below. These are indicated by solid bullets.

#### Equipment
* What equipment is provided and what must be purchased (and what are the costs)?
* How specific is the equipment to the work – is this going to present challenges in the future?
* What is the minimum level of technical expertise necessary?
* Determine which equipment is ‘dedicated’ and which is ‘non-dedicated’. It is important to understand the relationship of the display equipment to the installation. Many artists have strong views about the equipment to be used in the display of their work and see it as integral because of the impact it has on how the work is experienced. Each case must be considered individually to determine what is appropriate to change and what must remain constant in the display of a work. It is necessary to involve the curator and wherever possible the artist or their representative in these decisions. There are degrees of change: changing a particular item of equipment for one of the same make and model; changing the make and model but keeping the technology the same; changing the technology.

#### Dedicated equipment
* A particular item of equipment may be dedicated because it has been functionally or visibly modified or made by the artist (or for the artist) and is therefore irreplaceable.
* Specific makes and models of equipment may be designated by the artist as essential to the realisation and experience of their work. In such cases it is important to maintain this equipment even when it becomes obsolete.
* There may be instances when equipment is replaceable but remains assigned to the work of art as a legal stipulation in the acquisition agreement and is therefore not useable in any other installation.
* Equipment dedicated to a group of works: a group of works may depend on a particular make and model of equipment or technology that is becoming increasingly rare. In such cases you may wish to reserve the use of this equipment for this group of works.

#### Non-dedicated equipment
* Although the artist may have specific requirements for display equipment, the equipment may be generic and widely available. In such cases the actual piece of equipment is not assigned to the artwork but used for the display of a range of works.

#### Installation specifications
* How large a space is required?
* Does the installation require construction of a specific space?
* What specialist skills are required to install and keep the work running?
* What are the costs of installation and operation of the work?
* Review the installation specifications and determine if there is enough detailed information to properly install the work.
* An installation specifications template can be used as a starting point for the type of information you gather.
* If necessary, prepare additional questions for the artist/studio or gallery to get the information that you need.

#### Pre-acquisition assessment
* Is this work currently ‘exhibitable’ and can this be sustained?
* During this pre-acquisition phase, there is often limited time to gather important information necessary for making a presentation to a board, committee, or self.
* The goal at this point is to begin the process of assessment that will eventually lead to completion of structure and condition reports during the post-acquisition phase.
* At this stage, here are some core things to think about:
* Determine the ‘exhibitability’ of the media: assess the playback quality, if the offered format is provided at this stage. From an exhibition history of the provided materials, determine duration of previous display. Make recommendations for preferred media format if different from what is being offered.
* Assess the condition of display equipment offered with the work: how old is the equipment? How many times has it been used/ displayed? Has it ever been serviced?
* Assess the condition of the sculptural elements in the installation.

### Cost assessment
In addition to the costs itemised below, there will be long- and short-term costs associated with the care of time-based media. A cost-assessment worksheet will help to estimate the financial commitment necessary for acquiring the work.

#### Acquisition costs
* Will the available format need to be migrated before acquisition? Will the cost of this be covered by the buyer or seller?
* Are there crating and transit costs? Will they be covered by the buyer or seller?

#### Exhibition costs
Use essential conditions for display established above to determine costs, including extraordinary requirements such as:

* Artist/studio involvement
* Extended installation time
* Rented installation equipment
* Construction costs

#### Continuing collection care costs
* Estimate lifetime and replaceability of physical components: are there consumable elements that must be continually replaced?
* Understand equipment or consumables that are designated by the artist to be essential to the realisation of their work: consider purchasing back-ups for future preservation.
Outside contractors

## Proceed with acquisition? – Summarise findings and make recommendations for proceeding
* Using the information gathered from the assembled team and consultants, the curator/collector determines if the art work is an appropriate acquisition for the Collection. If yes, then the curator/collector identifies recommendations to incorporate into the purchase agreement.
* Identify issues for negotiation.
* Specify the preferred preservation and exhibition material required, e.g. master, sub-master, exhibition copy.
* Provide a final equipment list necessary for acquisition and display: what is provided by the seller? What must be additionally purchased?

### Key questions
* What rights do we need to secure as part of the acquisition of the work?
* Do we have what we need for the future conservation and display of the work?
* Can we make copies for exhibition and preservation?
* Does this acquisition warrant the need for formal legal documents?

### About the accessioning phase
<iframe seamless src="http://mhellar.github.io/intropages/imgmap/index2.html" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" width="1080" height="503"></iframe>

Contractual documents are required to acquire an artwork. Because of the complexities attached to the bundle of rights being conferred with the transfer of ownership of time-based media works, legal documents take on a greater significance than is the case with more traditional works.

These documents include a purchase agreement, or a deed of gift, and a copyright licence. They specify the terms and conditions of the acquisition and help ensure that all parties understand their respective rights and obligations.

The documents can be used among the following parties (which, in any given transaction, may be a museum, artist or artist’s estate, gallery or collector): purchaser, seller, donor, and copyright holder. Templates for the documents are provided here for reference purposes.

Depending, of course, on the terms of each transaction, they may be used as a starting point in negotiations.

## Accessioning guidelines
The accessioning phase lies between formally agreeing to acquire a work and actually being in a position, with everything in place, to accession a work into a collection. It is a moment when you make sure that you have everything that was agreed as part of the purchase or gift. In the case of traditional works of art, for example a painting, this is the moment when you check the painting arrived, that it is the painting you thought you were buying and that it is in the expected condition. The end of this phase is marked by legal title passing to the new owner.

There may be occasions when sculptures, paintings or other types of objects are also included as part of the work. However, for the majority of cases, what you are buying when you buy a time-based media work of art is not a unique material object but rather the means and the rights to be able to display the work, loan it, preserve it and sell it. To be able to enact these rights you will need to be in possession of preservation master material and information about how the work is to be installed.

### Notify the vendor
Once a decision has been made to acquire the work, it is important to notify the vendor or the donor of this intention as soon as possible. In some cases there may be strong competition for a particular work. It is important that the accessioning stage is completed as quickly and smoothly as possible.

### Verify artwork components
During the pre-acquisition phase the buyer will have familiarised themselves with the details of the work and established what is important to its installation and conservation. Preliminary discussions will have taken place to clarify what is being offered as part of the purchase price. During this phase those elements are delivered, and the recipient will have the opportunity to check that what has been agreed has arrived and that it is in good condition. In some cases, the vendor may wait to deliver the certificate until after payment.

### Secure and check preservation material
During the pre-acquisition phase, any tasks to be carried out during the accessioning phase to produce preservation material will have been identified. In some cases the vendor may supply archival material as part of the purchase. In other cases the recipient may agree to oversee the production and pay for the material needed. These discussions are best carried out as part of the initial negotiations. Once the payment is made and the acquisition completed, it can be very difficult to go back and ask for access to masters or request the rights to make copies for preservation. To help ensure that you have what you need to enable continued display of the work in the future, it is advisable to complete all archiving before the work is accessioned. It is also useful to specify any subsequent access that might be needed in a legal document such as a Purchase Agreement. If the work is being donated you may need to go back to the artist to ask for access to master material.

It is important to view the material you have received as part of the acquisition in order to check that its condition is as you expected. It is not unheard of to find problems with both media elements and any equipment provided as part of an acquisition. If equipment has been provided as part of a purchase, check what your situation is regarding the warranty.

### Exchange contracts
Contractual documents are exchanged during the accessioning phase. This may be as simple as an invoice; however there are cases where it is of benefit to all parties to have more detailed contracts. These documents include a purchase agreement, or a deed of gift, and a copyright licence. They specify the terms and conditions of the acquisition and help ensure that all parties understand their respective rights and obligations. The documents can be used among the following parties (which, in any given transaction, may be a museum, artist or artist’s estate, gallery or collector): purchaser, seller, donor, and copyright holder. Templates for the documents are provided for reference purposes.

Depending on the terms of each transaction, the templates will be modified and are offered here simply as a starting point in negotiations. A relationship of trust between the artist and their representatives and the new owner is important to successful custodianship. If you think that there is something controversial in the agreement, for example requests to stream the media elements online, discuss this with the artist first. Some artists may trust a museum and not worry about reading contractual documents carefully, it is therefore good practice to make sure they are aware of the content.

You are advised not to sign any agreement unless you first obtain legal advice. Sellers, Donors and Copyright Holders must bear in mind that these documents were drafted from the perspective of the Museum as Purchaser or Donee. The documents are also drafted from a generic perspective of UK and US law and should not be considered a substitute for legal counsel.

### The key acquisition documents are:
1. Purchase Agreement: a contract between the Seller of the work of art and the Purchaser that controls the terms of sale. OR
2. Deed of Gift: a document that memorialises the transfer of ownership of a work of art by way of gift. AND
3. Copyright Licence: because ownership of an artwork does not necessarily include ownership of the copyright to that artwork this document is an authorisation from the Copyright Holder to the Owner of a work of art permitting the Owner to, for example, reproduce the work in publications and/or for preservation purposes.

#### For all documents
Before signing the contract, you will have information in hand about the work [refer to Pre-acquisition Guidelines checklist]. You will already have considered the installation details, long-term preservation and exhibition requirements, future technological developments, as well as condition assessment. At this moment you might also wish to secure a Copyright Licence between you, the new owner of the work and the Copyright Holder. Although the artist normally retains the copyright in the work, you may want to secure rights to produce images and copies of the work for a range of purposes from publicity to preservation.

Please note the following with regard to the templates below:

* [Square brackets] have been used:

* where the information contained within them is optional or subject to change according to the particular circumstances.
* to comment on particular issues that should be addressed when tailoring this agreement.
* all square brackets should eventually be removed (using the search facility) and the information within them modified or deleted before the Agreement is signed.

*** Red bold font** is used where the information contained within is optional as it specifically applies to time-based media.

Two copies of each of the documents used (for example, the Purchase Agreement or the Deed of Gift and the Copyright Agreement) are sent to the Seller for signature. Each party should retain one fully signed original.

#### Purchase Agreement

This template can be adapted for use in situations where there is more than one Purchaser (i.e. a joint acquisition sometimes referred to as a co-ownership agreement and would need to be reviewed with the relevant co-ownership agreement and relevant co-owner(s).)

In conjunction with the Purchase Agreement, secure a Copyright Licence with the copyright holder.

#### Deed of Gift
This template assumes a full gift between two parties. It can be adapted to situations where there is more than one Donee or if the gift is fractional.

In conjunction with the Deed of Gift, secure a Copyright Licence with the copyright holder.

Please note the following:

* Affirmation of Title is desirable but not crucial if you have done your pre-acquisition research. You need to assess the relationship with your donor to determine whether to pursue.
* Certificate of Authenticity: if donor is not in possession of, or cannot transfer it, you may need to obtain this document by other means, including contacting the artist, gallery or estate. In some cases there may be a charge for replacing a missing certificate.
* Red bold font is used where artist or artist estate are the donor. If the artist is not the donor, bear in mind that you may need to obtain documents by other means as well as deleting the sections of non-relevance.

#### Copyright Licence
This template is an agreement between the Copyright Holder (usually the artist) and the collector (referred to as the ‘Museum’ in the document). It can be used as a general licence agreement as well as a document specific to time-based media.

<!-- Post Acquisition -->

# Post-acquisitions

## Key questions
* What information do we need to have in place to establish a baseline record and for future record-keeping?
* What is needed to prepare for the future life of the work as part of our Collection?
* How do I prepare for interviewing the artist about the installation and conservation of the work?
* The goal of the post-acquisition phase is to prepare the artwork for long-term preservation and future installation. This includes organising information about the work in digital and hard-copy format.

## About the post-acquisition phase

![Process diagram highlighting the stages you should go through after acquiring a work of time-based media art](http://www.tate.org.uk/sites/default/files/styles/grid-normal-12-cols/public/images/node/243453.gif?itok=PahEtOeI)

The work is catalogued and documented during this phase, and images are created for public release and for internal use. The artist may be interviewed after acquiring the work to answer remaining questions about future conservation and display. Technical and conceptual knowledge about the work is used to create a long-term conservation plan.

The media, display equipment, and sculptural components are packed and stored in archival housing in favourable environments for long-term preservation.

## Notify artist
* All parties must be notified after completing the acquisition process, including the artist and vendor (or donor)

## Produce images
* Produce/acquire images for public release and internal reference

## Catalogue and inventory artwork
Time-based media works require more complex cataloguing than traditional works of art. Some collecting institutions create separate databases for the additional metadata associated with these works. Decisions about what information to catalogue and how to catalogue it must be made carefully, following discussion among registration, curatorial, collections management, and conservation staff, and information systems staff.

* Useful website for moving image archive cataloguing: IMAP Cataloguing Project
* Assign accession number/establish basic record in collections database

### Catalogue artwork
Enter detailed information about the artwork gathered during the acquisition process into collections database, minimally including:

* Artist, title, creation date, display dimensions
* Media format, duration
* Display equipment, sculptural components
* Provenance, exhibition history
* Accession/collection number
* Valuation, vendor cost
* Credit line

Additional information collected in the object file may be uploaded into the database or simply tracked and kept as hard copy.

### Inventory and label artwork components
* Media: e.g. video, audio, film, slides, hard-disk drives.
* Useful websites: [EAI Online Resource Guide](http://www.eai.org/resourceguide/formats.html); [Texas Commission Videotape Identification and Assessment Guide](http://www.arts.state.tx.us/video/)
* Dedicated display equipment: (e.g. screens, monitors, projectors, speakers, playback equipment, lights, cameras). Record manufacturer and model numbers; collect product manuals for all equipment
* Useful website: [Mona Jimenez: Artist Instrumentation Database](http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=708)
* Sculptural components: measure and record all objects to be installed.

### Organise collected information
#### Create object files, or binder, from the acquisition process
These files will grow as the work is exhibited, loaned, and conserved. Most institutions create separate files for different purposes such as acquisition, curatorial, conservation and registration. Most of this information will be stored electronically as well, in collections databases, text documents, and digital images.

### Document artwork
#### Review documentation from artist/vendor/donor
* Is it sufficient for long-term care and future installation?

#### Document installed artwork
Documenting time-based media art includes recording the work in its existing state as it enters the collection:

* Photograph the installation and its individual components
* Videotape the initial installation
* Archive installation plans and specifications for display

#### Conduct artist interviews
* The artist interviews may actually include communications with the artist, technicians, owners, gallery staff and others familiar with the artwork. The goal of these interviews is to gather information about technical history, exhibition requirements, artist intent, and technological obsolescence.
* (Guidelines for artist interviews may be found on the [INCCA website](http://www.incca.org/))
* Create archival transcripts of the interviews. If they can be shared and may benefit colleagues, consider joining INCCA and entering abstracts of the interviews on the [INCCA Artists Archives Database](http://www.incca.org/)

## Develop conservation plan
The conservation plan anticipates:

* Installation equipment: maintenance requirements and future equipment replacement
* Media migration cycle
* Storage specifications
* Future conservation strategies and costs

Additional information about conserving media works may be found at the following websites:

* [EAI Online Resource Guide for Exhibiting, Collecting, and Preserving Media Art](http://www.eai.org/resourceguide/)
* [IMAP Preservation 101](http://www.imappreserve.org/pres_101/index.html)

## Prepare for future display
* Make media exhibition copies as needed
* Project costs for future exhibition

## Pack and store artwork
* Proper archival storage and packing is crucial to the longevity of the artwork.
* A brief summary of storage concerns for media may be found in [IMAP’s Preservation 101 section on Storage](http://www.imappreserve.org/pres_101/index.html#storage)

# Frequently asked questions

**What are the main ways in which time-based media are bought and sold?**
There are two main ways in which artists working in video have traditionally made their work available. The first is through distributors and the second is through the fine-art gallery system.

**What is the difference between acquiring a work from a distributor rather than a gallery or dealer?**
A gallery or dealer will usually sell a work as unique, or part of a limited edition. A distributor will have different structures of payment depending on how you intend to use the work. Different formats may be bought for a particular screening or you may buy a media format with archival and exhibition rights. Restrictions apply, such as your ability to loan the work.

**Who are the largest distributors of video?**
EAI (Electronic Arts Intermix), Video Data Bank, Montevideo and LUX.

**What is the difference between film and video?**
Film is essentially a transparent photographic medium through which light is projected to create an image. It usually requires a negative and is frame-based. Video is an electronic system of encoding whereby images and sound are encoded as electrical waveforms or pulses and are stored via magnetic particles within a plastic substrate. To see the images, the electrical waveforms or pulses of energy have to be decoded. Video may be analogue or digital. Analogue video is stored as continuous waveforms; digital video is stored as a binary system of 0s and 1s encoded as electronic pulses.

**What am I really buying?**
In purchasing a work of media installation art you are acquiring a combination of content, hardware, instructions and rights.

**What does it mean to say a work is sold as a limited edition?**
When a work is sold as a limited edition, similar to prints and cast sculpture, the number of the edition is declared and fixed when the work first enters the market. Someone buying the work will receive a certificate that will state which number within the edition has been purchased:, for instance one of three. The edition is a way of creating rarity and control in the world of reproducible media.

**Who else owns an edition of the work?**
The gallery who represents the artist will keep details of all the owners of editions sold.

**What comes with the work?**
This is normally determined by the seller/gallery but the exact details are usually negotiable. An acquisition could include hardware, but at least should include instructions, rights, and archival master copy and an exhibition copy.

**What do I need to get?**
See the pre-acquisition summary. This will most often include documentation of the installation, provenance of the artwork, an equipment checklist including the distinction between what is required but not included in the sale, an outline from the artist as to intent special considerations for installations, an archival master and exhibition copies of the work.

**What is dedicated display equipment/non-dedicated display equipment?**
See the pre-acquisition summary 

**What are essential documents/contracts?**
See the pre-acquisition summary

**What are my rights and responsibilities as a buyer?**
Your rights and responsibilities are determined in the Purchase Agreement. You should have the right to exhibit the work and in most cases lend the work. Responsibilities may include preserving, migrating and maintaining the work.

**Do I get different rights if I buy the work as an edition rather than as a unique work?**
No: your rights to loan, display, preserve and sell the work are the same whether you buy a work as a unique work or as an edition. However if you buy a work as an edition of six, for example, another five people also have those rights. You typically do not have the right in either case to show the work in more than place at a time.

**What does the Copyright Agreement cover?**
The Copyright Agreement should specify the buyer’s rights with respect to display, preservation, lending, PR, and publication.

**Why do I need a copyright licence?**
Unauthorised duplication of a copyrighted work may violate the rights of the copyright holder. A copyright licence will establish and define the owner’s rights with regard to migration, the creation of exhibition copies and similar issues having to do with the duplication of the work.

**How do we know who holds the copyright – owner or artist?**
Most often the artist holds the copyright to his or her work. A seller claiming ownership of the copyright in the work should warrant that he or she has the rights and can confer them upon the buyer.

**What is a Certificate of Authenticity?**
The Certificate of Authenticity is a document signed by the artist or artist’s estate that certifies (a) that the work is a work of art and (b) that it is by the artist named in it.

**What is an Affirmation of Title and how does it differ from the Certificate of Authenticity?**
Affirmation of Title merely confirms the proper ownership of the copyright. It does not ensure the authenticity of the work of art itself.

**What is a master?**
A master is the source from which copies are made. The purchased archival master should be the one closest to the artist’s originally edited source tape, if the artist’s source itself has not been acquired.

**Who holds the master (artist original)?**
The artists most originally edited master may be held by a variety of stakeholders. The artist, a gallery, artist’s estate, museums and educational institutions have all been known to keep the artist’s master.

**What is an ‘Artist’s Proof’?**
The existence of one of more artist’s proofs may be declared alongside the edition. For example one might see ‘Edition of 6 with 2 APs’. Artist’s proofs function as editions belonging to the artist. Artist’s proofs are also sometimes sold at a later date. If an artists sells all their dedicated artist’s proofs they would then have to ask an owner for permission to show the work.

**What is an exhibition copy?**
The exhibition copy is the copy of the media used for the installation. This is can be used during the installation and should be considered replaceable.

**Whom do I contact for technical support?**
Contact a museum conservation department, gallery, consultant and/or artist/studio that are familiar with these types of works (see  pre-acquisition summary).

**How do I document the work of art?**
Documentation of the work usually includes a combination of photography, diagrams, schematics, legal documentation, Installation Specifications, and verbal/recorded accounts of the work.

**What should be included in archival files?**
See post-acquisition summary. These files will usually include a receipt for the artwork, condition reports, the invoice, an acquisition summary, the certificate of authenticity, a copyright agreement, the artist’s contact information, a commissioning agreement (if applicable), the curatorial rationale, correspondence and transcripts of an artist’s interview.

**What is a Condition Report?**
The Condition Report is a record that monitors the physical and electronic qualities of all components of the work.

**My collections management database only provides limited fields for cataloguing time-based art. Where can I learn more about additional fields?**
Many museums and private collectors are struggling with this. Some producers of museum catalogue databases will revise their software in the future (please lobby them). In the meantime, you may need to create a database specifically for your time-based media collections. The ‘Cataloguing Project’ of Independent Media Arts Preservation (IMAP) may serve as a helpful resource.

**How will the work last over time?**
Media works last through a process of migration, an assessment of documentation, an assessment of new replacement technologies, and interview with artists as to possibilities for future iterations.

**What are the recommended formats for migration?**
The recommended migration format changes over time. In many instances it is determined by broadcast industry standards. Ideally a professional uncompressed component digital tape format is the best format for storing video. An example of this is D5. However these formats are expensive and not always accessible, therefore a ‘lossless’ compression format is often recommended such as Digital Betacam (see EAI Resource Site). It is also becoming possible to store uncompressed video as data on computer tape formats such as LTO.

**Is a copied tape identical to the original?**
An analogue copy is never identical to the original and each time it is copied generational loss occurs. In the digital domain it is possible to achieve a perfect clone from one format to an identical format. However all digital tape formats are different and if you copy a digital tape made on one format to another format, changes will occur. This is due to differences in sampling rate, how the data is sampled and differences in the compression algorithms used.

**How do I prepare myself for equipment becoming obsolete?**
The best known preparation for obsolescence includes the stockpiling of equipment, information gathering, and dialogue with artists/technicians/corporations (through preservation planning).

**Where do I go for help?**
Matters in Media Art,  IMAP and EAI all have resource websites.
