# Matters in Media Art
This is the new and improved web site for the Matters in Media Art Project: [mattersinmediaaart.org](http://mattersinmediaart.org). This site aims to be a resource for collectors, artists, and institutions of all sizes caring for works of art that have moving image, electronic, and digital elements. If you have questions about how to acquire and preserve these works, here you will find practical tools and examples to guide you. Mattersinmediaart.org site is powered by [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), uses the [materialize](http://materializecss.com/) framework, and is hosted via GitHub pages.
