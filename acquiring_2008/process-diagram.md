# Process diagram

This diagram shows the process for acquiring time-based media works of art. The process is divided into three phases.

* Pre-acquisition
* Accessioning
* Post-acquisition

The circular structure of the stages in this diagram reflect the fact that they are not necessarily carried out in a linear order, and that the phases (pre-acquisition, accessioning and post-acquisition) may overlap. The text guidelines for each phase are however presented in chronological order, to clarify what each stage involves.
