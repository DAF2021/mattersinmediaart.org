Here are some color and grid examples. These colors can be used througout the site, but should not be all used side-by-side as seen here – pick a color for cards for a section and stick with it. Different color cards can be used on the same page, but should not appear side by side.

    This is a "card" that is full column width. They can be any width, but generally you can't really fit more than three in a row without it looking sort of funny.

Not sure about that red color – perhaps a bit too much. In any case, that is an example of how you can use more than one color card on the same page, just make sure they're not close enough that they'll be seen at the same time.


<div id="cost-slider" class="liquid-slider">


<div markdown="1">
<h2 class="title">This is a slider</h2>
It has a light gray background, dark gray text, and green (#00e676 green accent-3) arrows. The arrows are PNG files. It needs to have at least a few lines of content, or line breaks to fill it out, otherwise it looks funny.

Sliders are used when you have a series of content chunks that make sense to go in sequential order. They save vertical space, and add a different dimension of interactivity to the site.
</div>


<div markdown="1">
<h2 class="title">This is page two of the slider</h2>
* More content goes here.
* Sometimes bulleted lists
* Doesn't look too bad

The slider will automatically adjust its height to fit the content of each slide, but try if you can to make the length of each slide relatively uniform – or at least try to eliminate greate discrepancies. Click to the next slide to see why.

</div>


<div markdown="1">
<h2 class="title">This slide is long</h2>
As you can see, it is a little strange when you suddenly have a very long slide after a few that are shorter – it may mean that the user has to now scroll down to read the whole thing. It's not the end of the world, but try to avoid this. Click to the next slide. You probably haven't heard of them sriracha chambray fashion axe leggings hammock. Mlkshk plaid etsy whatever. Hella irony squid cold-pressed gastropub crucifix synth. Synth church-key marfa single-origin coffee. Franzen flexitarian microdosing, photo booth food truck drinking vinegar blue bottle blog seitan shoreditch lomo brunch mustache small batch. Occupy humblebrag tattooed, locavore slow-carb pop-up ugh tofu lo-fi +1 sriracha. Readymade photo booth YOLO, plaid kogi raw denim schlitz church-key sustainable seitan fanny pack messenger bag everyday carry.

DIY gentrify craft beer whatever, farm-to-table ramps meh deep v XOXO pour-over. 8-bit knausgaard gastropub normcore, authentic gochujang truffaut quinoa whatever pickled heirloom ennui kombucha. Keffiyeh paleo put a bird on it cornhole mumblecore small batch. Schlitz drinking vinegar trust fund, chia bitters tofu cray. Whatever food truck cardigan heirloom, YOLO meh pitchfork bushwick health goth raw denim chicharrones crucifix organic thundercats skateboard. Food truck single-origin coffee poutine chartreuse. Cardigan try-hard polaroid actually trust fund.


</div>

<div markdown="1">
<h2 class="title">See?</h2>
It's weird when there is a slide that is randomly longer than the slides that come before and after it. Try to avoid this if at all possible. I'm running out of things to say, but this slide needs to be just about this long so as not to have a scroll bar. There.

### Images always default to fill the column width, so make sure all images are at least 800px wide

> This is what a blockquote looks like. These are useful for having in-line quotes, sometimes reffered to as "pull quotes". A quote needs to be at least two lines long, preferably a bit more – otherwise they look funny.

You can refer to the markdown file for this page, but here is the HTML that gives the quote citation it's style. As you can see, this is the same class used for image captions:
