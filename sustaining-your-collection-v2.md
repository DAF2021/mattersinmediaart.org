Our aim is to provide information that is useful to those who are caring for their own collection of digital artworks outside an institution, as well as small, medium and large organisations. Throughout these pages, core principles are highlighted and approaches are suggested depending on the size of your collection and your available resources, namely skills, budget and infrastructure. For each section we invite you to complete a survey, which will act as a tool to help you to outline the needs of your collection. The results will form the basis for an overall preservation system design.

##Caring for Digital Art Collections: Core Principles
* Do to digital works as you would to any art work: identify, catalog, describe, treat, document, and track
* Be prepared to be unprepared: the necessary skills evolve constantly and will be found both within and beyond your walls
* Build storage for your present collection but lay groundwork for the future
* The budget to build collection storage is nothing without the budget to sustain it
* Digital collections require active maintenance and will not survive passive storage


##II. Core Practices

###A. Your collection

####1. Collection size and characteristics

To plan and develop a system for digital art storage, you will need to know some details about your collection and its possible growth:  

* Record descriptive and technical information about the works
* Capture information on both born-digital items and legacy material that will be migrated
* Monitor the growth patterns of your collection 
* Establish which collections are in the scope of your digital storage project

###B. Your resources

####1. Budget

Your budget may include costs for both preparing your collection for storage and establishing your storage infrastructure:

* Legacy media migration 
* Initial storage infrastructure
* Ongoing maintenance 
* Replacement and upgrade (every 5 years)
* Growth 
* People with expertise
* Consumables

####2. Skills

To build a team able to address the needs of your collection:

* Acquire new skills through workshops, research and conferences
* Leverage professional networks and community resources
* If you are in an institution, bring together staff from across departments, and collaborate with others outside your institution
* Consider the need for new roles and expertise

###C. Your systems

####1. Collection management

Your collection management system is an essential complement to your storage infrastructure, and should enable you to:

* Maintain an up-to-date inventory of all collection items
* Record acquisition details, including information about the artist, any donor or purchase information and any key provenance information
* Record exhibition or displays history, including loans
* Track the location of physical and digital parts of collections items, including the ability to track versions of digital files as they get transcoded or migrated
* Record condition information and technical information about an artwork to inform its ongoing management
