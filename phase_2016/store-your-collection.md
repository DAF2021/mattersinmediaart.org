title: Store Your Collection
---

At this phase, you have gained intellectual control over your collection by way of survey, cataloging, pre-ingest, and assessment. We have also covered assessing needs and requirements for designing a digital storage system for your particular needs. It is now time to consider how one packages digital collections material for long-term preparation, before placing the material in storage.

The essential challenge here is to ensure that when one pulls a digital object from storage after many years have passed, that the archival package contains information that affords one the ability to understand what the materials are, how they can be viewed properly, their purpose in relation to the artwork to which they belong, and finally the ability to validate and prove their authenticity. The following types of information can be considered for inclusion in an archival package in order to facilitate these preservation requirements:
File/ Group of files
Core metadata
artist
artwork title
identifying number you assign your works 
Information about the intended purpose or purposes of the material in the package (for instance "Artist Verified Proof")
Representation information/ characterization information 
Relationship information 
Fixity of content and metadata
When including any type of identifier that serves as a linkage between systems – for example an identifier that refers to a record stored in a collections management system – it must be ensured that such identifiers are persistent, meaning they are permanent and will never change.
