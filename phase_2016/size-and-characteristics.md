title: Size and Characteristics of your Collection
---


1. Ways to describe the size, and growth rate in your collection.
2. Ways to describe the scope, and formats in your collection.

To tackle the preservation of any media arts collection, it is important to understand its scope, size, and characteristics. Depending on the number of works in your collections and their formats, there will be differing requirements for their storage and management.
Conducting a survey is a very good first step. It will be invaluable in estimating current and future growth, budget, and required skillsets for preservation. It will also make you aware of any formats that may be threatened by obsolescence and need to become a priority in your further workflows.

To start a survey within an institution as a conservator, involve your registration and collections management department. This will not only help you with just the workload, but it will also raise understanding and awareness within other departments and bring more people “on board”.

# Characteristics of your Collection
Understanding the characteristics of your collection will also help you to get an idea of its approximate size, as different assets require different storage space sizes. It will, however, also show you what kind of skill sets you might need to acquire or bring to the table through other departments or people.

While audio files are also small in their size, as soon as you enter the territory of moving images, file sizes increase. For digital video, it is important to understand the different file formats and codecs, which can be divided into uncompressed, lossless (=mathematically uncompressed) and lossy (=compressed). Generally speaking, you would want the first two as your master files, and the latter as exhibition or viewing copies. Today, however, many devices already encode the video as it is being recorded. In this case, the least compressed version of the video is desirable. Contact the artist or gallery to understand the genesis of the work; this will help you determine if you have the right formats for long-term preservation. Under [[Develop your system/Prepare/Assessment]] you will find further information on video and codec formats as well as tools to help you identify them. 

If your collection has analogue or digital videotapes, identify which formats are present. This will help you classify their obsolescence and migration needs. Strictly speaking, every actual tape –analog or digital– is obsolete today and needs to be transferred. But there are levels here; and for example a U-matic tape is in a more threatened state than a Digital Betacam tape, but it is not as threatened as any open-reel format.

Videotapes in collections often have a perceivable format history and may consist of multiple generations. For one installation there could be, for example, one original open reel 1” master tape from the 1980s, one U-matic tape labeled “master” and one Umatic tape labeled “submaster”, both of unknown origin, one Digital Betacam labeled “archival master” and “transfer from 1” tape”, as well as several exhibition copies on U-matic tape, laserdisc, and DVD. In this particular example you will have to look at the “master” tapes, probably starting with the Digital Betacam and the 1”, to compare and assess which of them is of best quality for your transfer. This happens ideally together with a media conservator and/or a comparably knowledgeable transfer facility.

Software- and computer-based art as well as net art are usually folders of many, very small items and won’t have much impact on your storage space. These works of art require, however, a very unique and specific skillset to preserve, emulate, and/or migrate them, which –if there is no person on staff– can be found in collaborations with outside experts in software engineering.

# Video Characteristics
Video Formats 
Basics of Digital Video Formats
Understanding the basic characteristics of your video is critical to its proper care and conservation. You can easily find out more information on your file formats by using the inspector in quicktime or VLC or using a tool such as MediaInfo which will detail the technical characteristics of your video files.  

Streams - each element of a digital video file is typically called a stream or track. This typically refers to the visual and aural information in the video file. 

Codecs - [Encode/Decode] the codec is how the visual and aural information is encoded in the file and is how the computer or playback systems knows how to playback the file. codec comes from the terms encode/decode. Examples of codecs are Uncompressed 8 or 10-bit, ProRes, H.264, MPEG-2, etc. 

Wrapper - the wrapper is how the video and audio streams are packaged together into one single file. There are many different kinds of wrappers for digital video, each with different features, capabilities, and characteristics. They can usually be identified by their file extension, for Eexamples: of wrappers are .mov, .avi, .m2v, etc. 

Interlaced - Video information was encoded using the interlaced method to reduce bandwidth in its transmission by splitting the frames of video material into even and odd fields. Due to the human eye’s ability to perceive motion through the persistence of vision, this split was not visually recognizable when represented on a monitor with a scanning raster such as a CRT.

vs Progressive - Video information was encoded using the interlaced method to reduce bandwidth in its transmission by splitting the frames of video material into even and odd fields. Due to the human eye’s ability to perceive motion through the persistence of vision, this split was not visually recognizable when represented on a monitor with a scanning raster such as a CRT. 
As bandwidth increased and transmission of video material transitioned from the analog realm into the digital realm, the progressive method of encoded became possible. This allowed for each discrete frame to be transmitted. Most modern flatscreen monitors utlize this method of playback. 

Color Space - the representation of color in video is done by using a reference gamut to accurately display color. In standard definition video, this was done using the YCbCr (also known as YUV) color encoding system. High Definition video utilizes YUV, RGB and sRGB as typically color spaces. 

Chroma Sub-sampling:
Chroma subsampling is typically represented in a series of 3 numbers which correspond to the Luminance (Y) and Blue color (Cb) and Red color (Cr). The ratio is how many times one signal is sampled in either the analog or digital encoding in relation to the others. A typical subsampling ratio is 4:2:2 which means the luminance information is sampled twice as many times as the color information is. This is actually based on the rods in cones in the human eye, where we are more sensistive to black and white information than color, so need a higher resolution in the detail than in the color information.

Standard Definition
Standard definition video, as the name implies, is based on broadcast industry standards. The two main standards are NTSC and PAL. 
NTSC - 480 X 720, 29.97fps, interlaced. 
PAL - 576 X 720, 25fps, interlaced.

High Definition 
High Definition video is a catch all term that applies to video material that exceeds the resolution of standard definition video. This is can be anywhere from 720 lines of resolution upwards to 8,000 lines (typically referred to as 8K). The key characteristics of high definition video is resolution, color space and frame rate.

# Size of your Collection
When calculating the size of your existing collection, there are two fundamental categories of collections materials that require different assessment strategies::

Already existing digital art, living on hard drives, USB-sticks, and optical discs.
Analog and digital video tape, needing to be transferred to digital file.

To estimate the size of digital video art living on external storage devices, examining each individual work as part of your survey will give you not only the number and size of each work, but also an insight to an artist’s way of distributing, housing and sharing their work of art. Often those hard drives contain more than one type of a file, for example pre-made exhibition copies and a master file, as well as additional information, like installation instructions or press releases.

In Prepare/Assessment we will name tools on how you can further examine your digital video file, how to assess its visual condition, and if you have the right file formats for long-term preservation.

# Storage Calculator
Placeholder for instructions on how to use the storage calculator. 

# Growth
Different types of organisations, collectors and artists in different financial environments have different constraints on budgets. Many storage solutions allow for expansion up to a point and then require another injection of capital expenditure hence understanding the costs is closely linked to being able to make predictions of existing size and growth. 

Currently many of those with digital video collections will be estimating growth of storage needs by looking at three factors: 

the number of tapes which are transferred from analog and digital video tape to digital file storage 
the number of file based works which need to be ingested into managed storage 
the number of new digital works coming into the collection

Where growth is closely linked to the number of new digital video works acquired into a collection it is difficult to predict precise growth. Therefore looking at trends regarding past growth is a useful indicator. The other two factors will depend on the number of works you plan to be able to move into managed storage and migrate from digital video tape in any one year. 

# Budget
When developing a budget for costs associated with the move from digital tape to digital file based storage and delivery, there are two different types of cost to consider: capital costs (one-time purchases of fundamental infrastructure or tools that will in theory last years) and ongoing or recurring costs that will become part of regular operating budgets and may increase as your collections grow.. 

some of the elements to consider:

Cost of project planning and communication 
Cost of staff updating your current systems and policies to take into account digital video files. For example you may need a new location to be agreed, you may need new field on your collection management system or to agree the metadata you will capture
Cost of staff in operating the workflow and carrying out quality assessment
Cost of project management. Whilst any project is underway progress will need to be reviewed, estimates and systems re-calibrated, policies developed
Cost of any new software, hardware and training 
Cost of storage infrastructure, this may include two levels: investment needed to set up and expand storage, as well as ongoing maintenance and support for existing infrastructure. infrastructure needed for significant step up in capacity and the unit costs within the existing infrastructure. Examples: Cooling, Power Consumption etc..
Cost of consumables such as data tapes

# Skills
As we move into the management of digital video as files, different skills and collaborations are needed. These skills may be provided by existing staff learning about new areas, by new collaborations being established or by hiring new staff or modifying job descriptions. If you are taking care of your own work, or in a small organization relationships with external providers may be a key way of accessing new skills. 

Ethics of conservation as applied to digital material
        -  (need text here)
Familiarity with Unix 
 - While you do not need to be an expert in the command line, a basic familiarity and understanding of unix is crucial in caring for digital video files. 
Understanding of Digital Video
 - A basic understanding of how digital video operates is imperative in properly caring for this material as well as interfacing with other collaborators, vendors and IT. This includes how video is encoded, the basics of luminance and chrominance sub-sampling, resolution, colorspace and frame rate. 
Ability to identify codecs and wrappers
 - Codecs and wrappers can be considered the video signal and instructions on how to play back this video. Given the speed of codec development and progression, the ability to identify codecs is necessary in gaining both intellectual control over your collection as well as identifying potential risks to the long-term preservation of your digital video material. 
Ability to do diagnostics on files
 - Using various tools allows you to gain an understanding of what the files you have consists of and how to best care for them. 
  - MediaInfo 
  - FFprobe
  - QCTools 
Understanding and Ability to perform transcoding 
 - Much like how tapes in the analog realm were reformatted periodically as tapes progressed in terms of resolution, digital video files will be regularly transcoded for preservation and access. 

Understanding of various display technologies
tied to an understanding of video technology is a basic understanding of various display technologies so that you can ensure you are faithfully playing back your digital video. This includes the basic mechanics of Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) displays, Flatscreens (LED, Plasma, OLED, LCD, and various playback devices (Brightsigns, DVD players, Blu-ray players, etc.).
