Our aim is to provide information that is useful to those who are caring for their own collection of video artworks outside an institution, as well as small, medium and large organisations. Throughout these pages key principles are highlighted and approaches are suggested depending on the size of your collection and your available resources, namely skills, budget and infrastructure. For each section we invite you to fill in a survey, this will act as a tool to help you to outline the needs of your collection. The results will form the basis for an overall preservation system design.

## Scoping Your Context

The best way to approach the challenge of sustaining your digital art depends on your context; a key element of this context is the nature of your collection. This section therefore focuses on assessing key facts about your collection of digital art, for example how large it is and what types of formats exist. The survey provided in this section is designed to help you to gather all the core information.

There are Core Principles that underpin the management of digital collections; however there are different ways (systems, tools, and procedures) to realise these Core Principles. The best way forward will depend on your context, i.e. the size of your collection, your infrastructure, available expertise and budget. This survey has been designed to help you to establish an overview of your digital collection.

### Scoping Your Collection

#### Collection Size and Characteristics 

The first step to planning what you need is understanding what you have, and how it might grow.

###  Scoping your resources

####  Budget

When developing a budget for costs associated with the development and implementation of storage for digital art collections, there are two different types of cost to consider: capital costs (one-time purchases of fundamental infrastructure or tools that will in theory last years) and ongoing or recurring costs that will become part of regular operating budgets and may increase as your collections grow.

####  Skills 

The management of digital artworks requires different skills, and teamwork is essential. New skills may be acquired through education and training of existing staff, establishing new collaborations, or by hiring new staff or modifying job descriptions. Larger organisations might be able to pull together a team from across departments who together have these skills. 

If you are taking care of your own work, or if you are in a small organization, relationships with external providers may be a key way of accessing those who have the necessary skills.

### Scoping your systems

#### Collection Management 


[Image]

Whether you are an individual artist or large institution, the first step in sustaining your digital art is knowing what you have, where it is located and how you do things.  

Most museums and large institutions have comprehensive collection management databases for tracking their artworks, and digital storage for their data infrastructure. In museums, databases are usually managed by the registration and collections management department, and data storage is usually in the realm of IT. In order to evaluate your current systems for the management of collection information for digital artworks, talk to the registration and collections management teams as well as any IT staff supporting the systems. It is important to find out how current management systems are functioning, what they are technically capable of, for example what backup systems are already in place.

No matter which collection management system you currently use, as you work through "Scoping Your Context" it is likely that the type of information you will need to scope your collection may already be found within this system, or alternatively you might want to add the information you generate through this process to your inventory. 

In most cases the information about an art collection will be formed of a rich cluster of records that have been compiled and edited over time. Often only a fraction of this information is held within a central database. Many institutions will also have records management systems for this associated documentation.

#### Storage Infrastructure 

The problem of bit preservation of data has been solved, however it does require careful management.

These same principles can be applied to a small personal collection of material as well as a fully automated system used within a museum.

When scoping your current storage infrastructure for the purposes of digital preservation it is helpful to understand the difference between standard storage setups and those suitable for digital preservation. Standard storage systems are designed for digital objects that are in active use and while backup procedures are usually included, they generally do not meet the more stringent requirements to ensure long term preservation of data. For example, within a normal institutional information technology set up, it is standard practice for backup tapes to be wiped and re-used after a few months. Active use storage is also unlikely to have a system in place to identify that information has changed or been lost as when data is changing all the time it is not possible to easily detect the difference between intended changes and accidental changes or damage to important data. In contrast, preservation storage systems require the active monitoring of data in order to detect unwanted changes such as corruption. They also have high level of redundancy meaning that material is copied in a number of locations to enable the data to be restored should a problem arise and they will also have a disaster recovery plan.

In assessing your current storage infrastructure it may be useful to ask the following questions:



[inline of survey]

#### Preservation Management 

What is a digital repository?

A digital repository for your collection is about more than just storage. There are many functions that can be carried out by a digital repository system in order to monitor and ensure the ongoing preservation of your collection objects. Just as for Collection Management systems, the way these functions are implemented will depend on individual circumstances. For a small, homogenous collection, many of these functions could be carried out manually. For a larger and more varied collection, there are significant benefits to having automated workflows and systems in place.

This is an area which has developed very rapidly in recent years, and many organisations have struggled to develop the infrastructure to keep pace with their growing digital collections. It is therefore important to understand that the term repository refers to a number of functions which need to be carried out and which are underpinned by some of the key ideas to emerge regarding digital preservation practice. 

These functions include:

* Automated workflows for the ingest of digital objects, including the extraction of metadata and packaging of the object and metadata for storage

* Generation of a persistent identifier for each digital object and a permanent relationship to associated metadata

* Generation of normalised masters where necessary. A normalised master is a preservation copy of a file in a standardised format. There is some debate regarding when the creation of normalised copies is advisable. In general video file formats are less vulnerable to obsolescence than tape formats. This is partly because it is easier to support software playback over time especially given open source tools such as ffmpeg. 

* Generation of access derivatives and an interface for user access to these derivatives, alongside associated metadata

* Generation of exhibition copies

* Auditing of system and user activities

* Active monitoring of file integrity

* Recording and reporting on collection characteristics, such as file formats

* Monitoring of preservation risks, e.g. file obsolescence and software dependencies

## Developing Your Digital Environment
</section>


<section id="developing-your-collection-policies" class="section scrollspy" markdown="1">

### Developing your Collection Policies

Before embarking on developing systems for the preservation of your collection it is important to define your objectives. You will be able to use the information youâve gathered in the âScoping your Collectionâ section to help you make informed decisions.

If you work for a large organisation you may have some work to do in convincing management of the need for digital preservation. A good first step will be to develop a policy that aligns digital preservation with the strategic objectives of your organisation. The policy should also articulate the roles and responsibilities for digital preservation and identify key stakeholders. 

Regardless of the size of your collection, you will need to establish the following principles and parameters. These will help determine your requirements for systems and plan your resources. 

#### Define the scope of your collection 

In order to plan for the storage and management of your collection, it is useful to define the categories of collection items and associated documentation that you hold. This might include the following:

* Master files provided by the Artist
* Copies of the master file made for preservation purposes
* Copies of the master file migrated to other formats or carriers
* Derivatives of the file made for access, exhibition or loan
* Documentation created or received relating to the creation process and intended display of the artwork
You will then need to consider 


<div id="collection-slider" class="liquid-slider">

<div markdown="1">
<h2 class="title"> <font color="ef5350"> Institution</font></h2>
âWe keep every file we receive from the artist. When we create derivatives for preservation purposes, exhibition, or loan, every new file is given a component number in our collection management system and stored in the repository, along with details about the creation of those files. We make an access copy that goes into our DAM, so that our staff can view the collection without needing direct access to the digital repository.â
</div>


<div markdown="1">
<h2 class="title"><font color="#40c4ff"> Collector </font> </h2>
âWe generally receive whatever the artist delivers us, though we have been making more of an effort to get master material. The bulk of the digital collection is H.264 .mov files for screening as well as ProRes or Uncompressed masters when we are able to receive them from the artist or gallery. In addition, we have been actively migrating our analog tape material to digital master files.â 
</div>

<div markdown="1">
<h2 class="title"> <font color="#00e676"> Individual </font> </h2>
âI focus on keeping master materials of my work on the hard drives I call my âarchive.â I donât have an organized way to keep the derivative files Iâve made for various other uses. Sometimes they donât make it into the archive, but I figure I can make any format if I have the master.â 
</div>
</div>


#### Organizing information about your collection 

You may have information about an artwork held in different places. This might include a Collection Management system, artwork records or metadata held with your digital files. 

The challenge here is to ensure that when you pull a digital object from storage after many years have passed you will have the information you need to understand what the materials are, how they can be viewed properly, their purpose in relation to the artwork to which they belong, and finally the ability to validate and prove their authenticity.

There is a certain amount of information you should make sure is held with the files, so that even if other information is lost, you still know what artwork it is and that the file itself has not changed. 

<ul class="collapsible" data-collapsible="accordion">
<li>
  <div class="collapsible-header">Core descriptive information</div>
  <div class="collapsible-body">
    <ul>
      <li>Artwork title and Artist Name. If you have a Collection Management System the descriptive information should also include an identifier to that artworkâs record. These identifiers must be persistent, meaning they are permanent and will never change.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</li>
<li>
  <div class="collapsible-header">Fixity</div>
  <div class="collapsible-body">
    <ul>
      <li>which will allow you to check that the file has remained unchanged (see section 2b for more information)</li>
    </ul>  
  </div>
</li>
<li>
  <div class="collapsible-header">Technical Information</div>
  <div class="collapsible-body">
    <ul>
      <li>The file will have technical information embedded in its header or wrapper. If you have a large collection, you should also consider extracting this information and storing it elsewhere, so that you can search across your collection.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</li>
</ul>

There is further information that will need to be kept in order to ensure an artwork can be preserved and displayed in the future. This can be either kept with the file or in other systems, like a database or Collection Management System.

#### Adhering to standards and best practices 

Digital Preservation is a relatively new and rapidly evolving field, but there are already a number of established standards for the management of digital objects and metadata. Adhering to these standards helps ensure that your files can be correctly identified and interpreted in the future, and that you will be able to share information about your collection between different systems. 

The most widely recognised standard for digital preservation is the <a href="http://www.oclc.org/research/publications/library/2000/lavoie-oais.html">Open Archival Information System (OAIS)</a>, developed by NASA and approved as an international standard in 2003. OAIS is a conceptual framework that defines the entities that make up an archive. Defining your designated community and ensuring that objects can be accessed and understood by this community are important concepts. The Trusted Digital Repository checklist is a useful tool for measuring your systems against the OAIS standard. 

Recording information about your collection in a standardised way will help ensure that the information can be accessed and understood in the future. It will also mean that systems will recognise this information and be able to use, share and index it. Examples of metadata and packaging standards are:
BagIt - A standard developed by the Library of Congress for the packaging of files with critical metadata, such as checksum information 

<a href="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a> - A standard for recording descriptive metadata 

<a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/">PREMIS</a> - An international standard for metadata to support the preservation of digital objects and ensure their long-term usability 

<a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/">METS</a> - a standard for encoding descriptive, administrative, and structural metadata. 

#### Define your preservation strategy 

</section>

<section id="developing-your-resources" class="section scrollspy" markdown="1">

### Develop Your Resources 

#### Budget
A budget is crucial to the development of your digital environment. No matter who you are, some cost will be necessary to collect and maintain digital artworks. Drawing from the results of the survey, you can start to develop how much storage you will need and begin costing for digital storage, infrastructure and support. This can range from budgeting for hard drives to developing a cost for a robust repository supported by IT staff. Below are 3 examples of different budgets and the necessary considerations to develop these budgets. 

<div id="budget-slider" class="liquid-slider">

<div markdown="1">
<h2 class="title"> <font color="ef5350"> Institution</font></h2>
 âWe have a dedicated budget for staff and collections care for digital collections, as well as a budget for building and maintaining our storage infrastructure. Budgets are revisited annually as our growth estimates evolve.â 
</div>


<div markdown="1">
<h2 class="title"><font color="#40c4ff"> Collector </font> </h2>
âWe do have a budget primarily for storage and modest conservation assessments and costs. This budget was originally designed around physical storage for objects, but we have since expanded it to include budgeting for digital storage. We have a running storage cost for cloud storage [insert Amazon cloud costs here] and back up everything else to LTO tapes.â 
</div>

<div markdown="1">
<h2 class="title"> <font color="#00e676"> Individual </font> </h2>
âWhat budget? I have zero budget, so everything I invest in cataloging and storage feels like a stretch. But I do realize I have to keep track of my work and pay attention to storage, or else I risk losing my work. Itâs hard to allocate money to save back-ups of my work when itâs not like itâs earning tons of money, but by keeping things simple I think Iâve been able to cover the basics at a reasonable cost.â 
</div>
</div>

In order to be able to establish a budget you will need to have gathered the following: 


<ul class="collapsible" data-collapsible="accordion">
<li>
  <div class="collapsible-header">Information about your collection</div>
  <div class="collapsible-body">
    <ul>
      <li>namely how much material you need to store, what formats it is on, the size of the files if the material is stored as digital files and the duration of the material if it is on tape (see Scoping Your Collection).</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</li>
<li>
  <div class="collapsible-header">Guiding Principles</div>
  <div class="collapsible-body">
    <ul>
      <li>
        Guiding principles that you have decided to follow regarding the management of your collection. Examples of these principles or policies include:
        <ul>  
        <li> * Decisions about what will you store? Artist supplied masters, archival masters (these might be copies of the files where something has changed for example they have been transcoded into a different format, whether you want to store a current exhibition format, whether you want to store all the formats in which you have this material, whether you want to store an access copy).</li>
        <li> * Decisions about whether you will keep each different component stored on its own with its own metadata or will you keep all the components you have with a particular artwork together?</li>
        <li> * Decisions about what type of metadata and documentation will you keep with your components and what will be kept elsewhere?</li>
        </ul>
         </li>
    </ul>  
  </div>
</li>

    <div class="collapsible-body">
      <ul>
        <li> Information about how long processes will take of someoneâs hands on time (some processes might take many hours of computer time to process but they only need to be monitored rather than take 100% of someoneâs time). Example processes are initial assessment of material, cataloguing and documentation, preparing for ingest or transfer to storage, ingest or transfer to storage. If you want your budget to link to planning you might also want to know how long it will take to complete the process from start to finish for a single item.

      </ul>
    </div> 
  </li>
</ul>

#### Roles

There are some skills necessary for the proper care and maintenance of digital objects. Not everyone will be able to acquire ALL of the necessary skills, so collaboration with others is crucial to the successful care of your digital collection. Whether you hire outside consultants or staff, here is a list of skills that are necessary to for the development of your digital environment.

### Developing Your Systems and Processes 

This section will offer guidance on developing your own systems based on the nature of your collection and the available resources. These pages consider the different roles and responsibilities, hardware and software infrastructure and documentation models involved in developing a system for the preservation of digital art and examine the processes that tie them together. This will serve as a resource guide for designing your preservation system.

####  Collection Management 
Information about your collection thatâs held in one location, often called a Collection Management System, forms the core of your collectionâs management and allows for the following functions: 
Providing an inventory of all collection items
Recording acquisition details, including information about the artist, any donor or purchase information and any key provenance information
History of exhibitions or displays, including loans
Tracking the location of physical and digital parts of collections items, including the ability to track versions of digital files as they get transcoded or migrated
Recording condition information  and technical information about an artwork to inform its ongoing management

> âI used to use a spreadsheet, but it got unwieldy with too many objects. Itâs also designed for calculations and data manipulation, not keeping discrete object records. I now have a database that can accommodate much more information, and is much easier to navigate and search.â - Individual 

Depending on your context and the size of your collection, a collection management system will look very different. For a small institution or individual collector, collection management functionality could be carried out using a database or spreadsheets, templates and standardised metadata. For a larger institution, a managed database will be necessary in order to:

* provide a central information point with a consistent level of information about an entire collection regardless of medium or type
* facilitate certain core workflows (for example an acquisition process or loans process)
* provide auditing and reporting functions
* allow for access to information and the ability to edit information to be defined at a user level  
* allow for multiple users to update information and keep it current

The larger the number of users and objects and the more complex the workflows the more necessary a specialised database, ie. a collection management system, will become. Software to maintain an inventory could range from an Excel spreadsheet, a database like Filemaker, an open source collection management software such as <a href="http://www.collectiveaccess.org/about">CollectiveAccess</a> or <a href="http://omeka.org/about/">Omeka</a> to the type of collection management system employed by museums, for example <a href="www.gallerysystems.com/products-and-services/tms/">The Museum System (TMS)</a>, Mimsy or a bespoke system developed by your institution. 

> âWe use a free, web-based open source database thatâs designed for museums. It allows us to assign everything a unique identifier which is connected to the main artwork. We can add acquisition, loan, and location information to the main record, and even use barcodes to track movement of physical collection objects.â - Collector 

It is uncommon to find one system that will facilitate both the collections management activities outlined above, and also digital preservation. Therefore it is often the case that different systems and tools are used for serving these two different core needs â for instance the use of a digital asset management system, or a digital repository in addition to a Collection Management System. Before building or implementing any specialized systems beyond a Collection Management System however, it is important to consider how this specialized system will integrate and communicate with your collection management system.    
In a completely manual environment, you would be able to incorporate any additional information needed for the digital repository functions (for example checksum monitoring, format registry etc) and your core collection management information (for example location) into one database. For larger digital collections there are significant gains to be made in terms of time and accuracy in taking advantage of tools that automate certain functions within the workflow. This often creates information about your digital artworks which you will wish to record and maintain. Where specialist (often proprietary) databases exist, integration with any repository software or digital asset management systems can be a challenging, expensive and skilled operation.

> âWe are a museum using TMS. We create an object record for the work and then create separate components for each physical or digital object that is part of that work. It enables us to record attributes, relationships, and contextual information, effectively centralizing the essential information about complex works with many elements.â - Institution 


####  Designing your storage

This section outlines the key elements associated with the design and build of reliable storage for long term digital preservation. The content has been arranged to address a range of situations; whether you are an individual who is designing a low risk personal storage solution, through to a large organisation. No matter the size of your collection the following core principles need to be considered when designing your storage:

        <p>
         <ul>
          <li> Geographic Rendundancy - Multiple copies of data should be held at different geographical locations, and a disaster recovery plan should be in place. </li>
          <li> Fixity Checking - Regularly monitoring digital files in order to detect corruption or unwanted changes to your data. </li>
          <li> Access and Security - The speed and restriction of access to data needs to be appropriate for its intended use and the level of protection required. </li> 
          <li> Technology Monitoring - Trends in storage technology should be monitored to assess when migration to new storage media will be necessary.</li>

#####  Geographic Redundancy 
Hardware: potential options (2016)

* 0 to 5TB in the next 5 years and small budget -RAID 1
* 5TB to 25TB - RAID-5 or 6 or 7
* 25TB and higher - some kind of enterprise storage - OR - multiple RAID 5 or 6 or 7 that support daisy chaining

Keeping multiple copies in sync: potential options

* Manual (sneakernet)
* Peer-to-peer file sharing (P2P)
* Cloud service (i.e. dropbox, crashplan, http://www.cloudwards.net...)

âI want to keep this as simple as possible so to achieve my 3 copies and multiple geographical locations, I purchased three RAID 1 drives. One for my studio, one for my home, and one for my friendâs home. To keep my three RAID 1 drives in synchronisation I manually sync my studio drive with my home drive on a weekly basis, and then manually sync with my friendâs drive twice a year.â

âI have about 10TB of data, which I do not access that frequently and have the funds to pay an annual fee to storage my data in the cloud.â 
âWe have about 10TB of data, and expects to only have 15TB in five years, so we have two 18TB RAID devices that plugs right into my Mac at  home and the office. I pay an annual fee for a cloud backup service, which we can use to keep our two locations in synchronization, as well as having the benefit of the third copy in the cloud.â

 âI manages a collection that currently has 35TB. Based on acquisition analysis I estimate that over the course of the next five years, we will grow to around 50TB. In consultation with our IT department, I found out that they actually already have some storage infrastructure at two locations, both of which can scale to this size. They added the amount of storage that we needed for this yearâs growth, and have budgeted for the anticipated growth over the next five years. I conveyed to IT that these digital artworks are very valuable, and so they have set carefully considered read/write access permissions that are more restrictive than the policies set for other kinds of data managed on this system. Ideally we should have three copies in three locations, but unfortunately the budget can not accommodate cloud storage, or building a third data center, so as an alternative I currently manually back the data up to LTO tapes which we store in a third location in the event that we need to recover from a disaster.â

The lifetime of a hard-drive varies from three months to five years. If you only have one hard drive and it breaks down, data recovery is very costly, and can be catastrophic. As a rule of thumb: One copy is no copy. Save three copies of your data on at least two mediums (e.g. hard drive, server, LTO tape, flash drive, cloud) and in at least two geographic locations.
In the Storage Options section  each type of storage pool has different characteristics. These characteristics are generally dictated by the purpose of any given copy of your data. A duplicate copy of your data may be maintained for high availability, disaster recovery, or recovery from accidental modification or deletion (or a combination of these purposes).

High-availability: This is a redundant copy of your data maintained for the ability to provide easy access to the data with no downtime in the event of loss of the primary copy. Typically this means an exact duplicate of the primary infrastructure at an off site location, with an equivalent connection to the outside world or access points. This infrastructure would contain a complete and up to date copy of your entire collection. With high-availability copies of data, ease of access is paramount.

Disaster recovery: When maintaining a copy of data for disaster (for instance, in the event of fire, flood, or earthquake) recovery purposes, the goal is simply to be able to retrieve, rebuild, and access your data. Within reason, ease of access is not a priority. An LTO tape stored off-site is one example of a suitable medium for a disaster recovery backup.

##### Fixity Checking 

When creating a secure storage environment for your data, you will want to make sure the data itself stays safe and does not change without your knowledge. This process is known as fixity, and in digital preservation this is achieved by generating checksums for your files which are monitored by re-checking, on a regular basis.

Simply put, your file is run through a certain algorithm (the most commonly used algorithms are MD5 and SHA) that produces a unique alphanumeric sequence. The slightest change to your file will produce a completely different checksum. With this simple process, it is possible to identify any changes to your files. The types of changes which can be identified with this method are those which indicate corruption, loss of data, or unintended manipulation. If you have an automatic monitoring system in place, it would alert you if such a change occurs.

Calculate checksums as soon as youâve received or created a file. This could mean creating checksums as you export a file from the hard drive on which an artwork was received, or as soon as you have exported a file from an editing program or on digitized a tape.

RAID and enterprise storage systems, provide what could be considered a basic form of fixity. Data in these systems are monitored for integrity at the block-level â meaning the smaller blocks of data that a file is composed of. If one hard drive fails, the system can restore the lost data by using the redundant data block and the checksum. This however only detects data corruption that occurs as the fault of the storage device itself â it would not be aware of the accidental corruption, modification, or deletion of a file as enacted by a user or piece of software. In digital preservation we use checksums at the file-level in addition to block-level checks. 

A checksum enhances these block-level checks insofar as it is a portable piece of evidence that can travel with a file, and be checked, regardless of storage the type of storage system it resides on â  it can prove that a file has not been modified since chain of custody was established.

Checksum Tools 

These tools can simply generate checksums â out of the box, they will not necessarily store the checksum value, or facilitate the verification of a checksum.

* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Md5sum">md5</a> - This can be run via Terminal on Mac or Linux. 
* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sha1sum">shasum</a> - This can be run on Mac, Linux and Windows. 
* FCIV (File Checksum Integrity Verifier) â windows command line tool for generating MD5 or SHA1 checksums.

These tools create checksums, store the values, and facilitate the verification of checksums after the fact.

* <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201259">Checksum+ (OS X)</a> -  With this tool you can just select a file and it will create a checksum for you, stored within an .md5 file, in the same location, with the same name as your file. Double-clicking this .md5 file will run a fixity check and tell you, if everythingâs ok. If you open it with a text editor, it will show you the MD5 checksum as well as the file it is pointing to. It is important that both the .md5 and the original file are stored in the same folder. 
* <a href="http://www.fastsum.com/">Fastsum</a> - for windows.
* <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BagIt">BagIt</a> - developed by the Library of Congress, this tool is used in a command line interface[2]. BagIt was originally created to safely transfer files from one place to another, by packaging the original data in a âbagâ (folder) and creating checksums for each file within that bag. It also stores information about the date and software version as text-files within the bag, and creates checksums of all these text-files, including the checksum files themselves., https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1763D432BE25663D 
* <a href="https://www.avpreserve.com/tools/fixity/">Fixity</a> - AVPreserve has created a tool hat enables the user to identify seven directories that the program can check automatically on a monthly, weekly or daily basis.  
* <a href="https://www.archivematica.org/">Archivematica</a> - comes with a command-line based tool for running fixity checks
* <a href="https://www.nagios.com/products/nagios-core/ ">Nagios</a> - The open source industry standard in IT infrastructure monitoring and alerting  Various checksum plugins are available, http://bit.ly/1p5KDGO

âI generate checksums using BagIt at the point of acquisition to ensure safe transport to my centralized storage device. Once the materials enter our repository, AVPreserveâs âFixityâ tool is implemented. Itâs incredibly useful because it runs in the background, and not only alerts us to modified files, but also deleted, moved, renamed and new files since the previous check.â

<h2 class="title"> <font color="#40c4ff">Collector</font></h2>
âI immediately use BagIt to transfer my files onto the server from the acquired hard drive into a bag and put a schedule in place where I verify the checksums monthly. Since I have my files in 3 locations, I run the âbag verifyvalidâ command on all of the bags in all three locations. I used to do this manually, but my IT department wrote a very simple bash script that runs the âbag verifyvalidâ command against any and all bags in the location supplied to the bash script.â

<h2 class="title"> <font color="#00e676">Individual</font></h2>
âI donât manually create or check any checksums, but I researched it thoroughly and found that the cloud service that I use for syncing between my three locations does in fact checksum files, and retain infinite version history. So if I ever found that I couldnât open a file because it became corrupt, or was accidentally deleted, in theory, I could revert back to the last known good state. The only downside to this is that it doesnât automatically notify me if something is deleted, modified, or corrupted, because it doesnât know the difference between accidental and intentional modification.â
</div>

> âI partner with my IT department as they have to meet standards of something called PCI compliance which requires them to have software for monitoring file integrity for security purposes. They have software such as Nagios or Tripwire, which can be configured to schedule the monitoring of checksums and they handle the enterprise reliability of these systems in addition to sending me email alerts if anything has changed.

We use an on-premises but remotely managed digital preservation software as service (SaaS) solution. We generate checksums using BagIt at the point of acquisition, but once materials enter our repository, fixity is monitored and managed by our service provider.â - Institution


##### Access and Security 

<div id="budg-slider-2" class="liquid-slider">

<h2 class="title"> <font color="ef5350"> Institution</font></h2>
âDifferent levels of permissions are set and maintained by our Digital Repository Manager, and every time a digital collection object is downloaded, there is a record of who did so and why.â
</div>
<div markdown="1">
<h2 class="title"><font color="#40c4ff"> Collector </font> </h2>
âAccess is only open to the small staff of the collection. The RAID is internally networked and does not point âoutâ. There is some concern about the cloud storage system but weâve been told itâs fairly secure. The LTO tapes are stored within our general art storage facility, which maintains a fob and key system.â
</div>

<div markdown="1">
<h2 class="title"> <font color="#00e676"> Individual </font> </h2>
âMy biggest concern is people using master material without permission. Once I provide high-quality materials for one purpose, they sometimes travel and reappear elsewhere without permission. In my studio itâs not an issue; access is pretty open.â 
</div>
</div>



##### Technology Monitoring 


<div id="eq-slider" class="liquid-slider">

âWe are able to generate statistics on the file types in our repository and we can plan accordingly.â
</div>
<div markdown="1">
<h2 class="title"><font color="#40c4ff"> Collector </font> </h2>
âI try to keep up with what are considered the best file formats to choose for long-term preservation of my master materials, using blogs and white papers put out by the digital preservation and conservation fields. However, I usually find out something is out-of-date when it stops working. I have had trouble with my back-up hard drives when I upgrade my computer or operating system, and then I have to use the old computer to move things onto new drives.â
</div>
<div markdown="1">
<h2 class="title"> <font color="#00e676"> Individual </font> </h2>
âWe lean on the expertise of our consultants to tell us what we should be looking out for. We generally try to keep to digital preservation best practices of little to no compression, open formats, etc. In terms of systems, we again rely on our consultants, who we bring in at least once a year, to assess our storage and file needs and make recommendations for us.â
